there was no doubt, judging by the unmistakable frustration in arsène wenger’s voice, which team could be the more satisfied with the result.
arsenal’s manager briefly tried to argue that victor wanyama should have been sent off and made an even less convincing case that tottenham hotspur’s penalty should not have been awarded on the basis that laurent koscielny’s foul was not deliberate, dangerous or denying mousa dembélé a scoring opportunity – absolutely none of which matter a jot if one is going to be old-fashioned and apply the rules.
thankfully wenger did eventually return to a far more legitimate point, accepting that arsenal had lost their way in a second half that was a reminder of tottenham’s competitive qualities.
“our level dropped,” wenger said.
“we looked flat, physically.” the same could not be said of their opponents and, though tottenham have now gone seven games without a win in all competitions, on this evidence it would be misleading to think mauricio pochettino is overseeing a team in distress.
pochettino’s men showed the kind of togetherness that made them authentic title contenders last season.
they are not passing the ball as fluently but dele alli was ruled out with a knee injury and harry kane is still short of fitness, lasting only until the 72nd minute on his first start in seven weeks.
spurs still look better with him back in the team and perhaps a fully firing kane would have accepted one of the chances he missed either side of scoring their penalty.
the second one, in particular, looked like the kind of chance kane would usually accept and tottenham could also reflect on the moment, late on, when christian eriksen’s free-kick curled beyond everyone and bounced off a post.
that would have been lucky but pochettino’s men had finished as the more likely winners in a compelling, fluctuating match when the speed and frequency with which the game swung from one end of the pitch to the other created an absorbing spectacle.
arsenal, however, undoubtedly finished with the greater sense of exasperation.
spurs had started encouragingly but the home team produced some thrilling attacking football when they took command during a 20-minute spell of sustained pressure late in the first half, bringing an own goal from kevin wimmer and several other chances.
“in the first half we looked like we could score every time we crossed the halfway line,” wenger said.
pochettino was certainly taking a gamble by experimenting for the first time with an unorthodox 3-3-2-2 formation in such a key fixture and it was not easy at that stage to remember the visitors had the best defensive record in the league.
theo walcott and alexis sánchez caused them plenty of problems, with mesut özil always in close proximity, and alex iwobi really should have given arsenal the lead after the best passing exchange of the first half.
iwobi trundled his shot into the arms of hugo lloris with so little conviction it was tempting to question his big-game mentality.
the same player later chose the wrong pass from another threatening break, provoking a rare show of anger from özil, before walcott almost scored a beauty with a rising 25-yard shot that rattled lloris’s left post, close to its point with the crossbar.
tottenham did, however, have legitimate grievances about the opening goal on the basis that sánchez and shkodran mustafi had both strayed offside when özil curled over the free-kick that led to wimmer heading into his own net.
wimmer was making his first appearance in the premier league this season, brought in as part of a new-look three-man central defence, and his only possible mitigation could be that the two offside players were in his line of vision.
even then the austrian defender should have avoided what happened next.
arsenal have lost only one of these fixtures at their own stadium in the last 23 years but there is another statistic that says they have not beaten spurs in the league during the pochettino era and wenger did not really find wholehearted support in his post-match complaints about wanyama’s first-half clash with walcott.
dembélé’s switch to a slightly more deep-lying position was a subtle yet important change for the second half.
eriksen became more influential and son heung-min was prominently involved, with danny rose operating as a wing-back and kyle walker doing the same on the other side until he was forced off in the second half with an injury.
“you need to be flexible,” pochettino said of the new system.
“in the last month we’ve had some small problems so we tried to find a better solution with our full-backs higher up the pitch.
we showed a strong performance and we worked hard.”
dembélé still had the licence to roam forward and it was his run from right to left, eluding francis coquelin and then coming inside nacho monreal, that prompted koscielny to make the challenge that led to the penalty five minutes after the interval.
koscielny had clipped the player, rather than the ball, however much wenger tried to argue it was unjust.
kane took advantage of petr cech diving out of the way by aiming his shot down the middle and, ultimately, the draw felt like a fair outcome.

beirut —  kurdish-led syrian forces began an offensive sunday to liberate the islamic state group's de facto capital of raqqa, clashing with the extremists north of the syrian city and warning neighboring turkey not to interfere in the operation.
the united states, france and britain said they would provide air support for the offensive, which was announced at a news conference in ein issa, north of raqqa, by a coalition of kurds and arabs known as the syria democratic forces.
but it lacked details on how the group dominated by kurds plans to oust the militants from the city, home to nearly 200,000 mostly sunni arabs and an estimated 5,000 is fighters.
unlike several successful military efforts to drive islamic state militants out of cities in iraq, the raqqa offensive faces several political obstacles and is likely to be much more complex.
in iraq, a u.s.-led coalition is working with the government in baghdad, but washington and its partners in syria are relying on a hodgepodge of local arab and kurdish opposition groups, some of which are fierce rivals.
the tensions are exacerbated by russian and syrian forces on one side and turkish forces on another.
advertisement
still, the start of the raqqa offensive, which aims initially at isolating and encircling the city, increases the pressure on the islamic state group, making it harder for its fighters to move reinforcements between syria and iraq.
the city, which has been under is control since early 2014, is home to some of the group's top leaders and is seen as the key to defeating the group militarily.
advertisement
islamic state forces already are now under attack by u.s.-backed iraqi forces on the eastern edges of the city of mosul, which the militant group seized two years ago when it captured territory across iraq and syria for its self-proclaimed caliphate.
the iraqi forces began their operation oct. 17 and are trying to push deeper into the city, which is the militants' last urban bastion in iraq.
iraq's hezbollah brigades, one of the main shiite militias taking part in the government-led push to drive is from mosul, said wednesday its men had taken control of a highway linking mosul and raqqa, severing a key supply route between the two militant strongholds.
senior commanders and representatives of the sdf attended the news conference in ein issa, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) north of raqqa.
the kurdish officials said the anti-is campaigns in mosul and raqqa are not coordinated but simply a matter of "good timing."
"we call on our heroic steadfast people in raqqa and surrounding areas to stay away from enemy gatherings which will be a target for the liberating forces and the coalition forces, and to head to areas that will be liberated," said cihan ehmed, an sdf fighter.
she said 30,000 fighters will take part in the offensive, dubbed "euphrates rage," and that a joint operations command had been set up to coordinate various factions.
"i welcome today's announcement by the sdf that the operation to free raqqa from isil's barbaric grip has begun," u.s. defense secretary ash carter said.
"the effort to isolate and ultimately liberate raqqa marks the next step in our coalition campaign plan.
"as in mosul, the fight will not be easy and there is hard work ahead, but it is necessary to end the fiction of isil's caliphate and disrupt the group's ability to carry out terror attacks against the united states, our allies and our partners," he added.
activists reported clashes sunday between is militants and sdf forces north of raqqa.
sdf forces seized control of six villages and farms, the britain-based syrian observatory for human rights said.
it also reported strong activity by u.s.-led coalition warplanes and airstrikes that hit is positions.
the observatory also said is detonated two car bombs targeting the advancing forces.
advertisement
the raqqa-based syrian activist group known as raqqa is being slaughtered silently also reported the clashes south of ein issa.
there was no immediate comment from the government of syrian president bashar assad on the kurdish announcement.
brett mcgurk, the white house envoy to the anti-is coalition, said the u.s. will provide air support for the raqqa offensive and is in "close, close contact" with its ally turkey.
"we want this to be as coordinated as possible, recognizing that there will be a mix of forces on the field," he told reporters in jordan.
britain also said it is providing aerial surveillance to help the offensive.
the royal air force "will support the raqqa operation as it develops," defense secretary michael fallon said.
french defense minister jean-yves le drian said his country will provide airstrikes to aid the offensive.
he told french radio europe 1 that "local territorial forces" should retake raqqa with air support from the coalition but no foreign ground troops.
the sdf is dominated by the main syrian kurdish fighting force known as the people's protection units, or ypg.
the u.s. considers the group to be the most effective force against is, but turkey views it as a terrorist organization linked to a kurdish group outlawed by the government in ankara.
turkish officials, including president recep tayyip erdogan, have said they will not accept a role for the kurds in the liberation of raqqa.
turkey's defense minister suggested last week that instead of the kurds, turkish-backed forces can present an "alternative."
in a speech sunday, erdogan did not comment on the sdf announcement but said allied syrian opposition fighters were 9 miles (15 kilometers) from the syrian town of al-bab, the last stronghold of the is group in aleppo province.
he added that turkey's aim was to move on al-bab and expel the militants toward the south.
advertisement
"our hope is that the turkish state will not interfere in the internal affairs of syria," ehmed said at the news conference, suggesting sdf forces would defend themselves if it did.
"raqqa will be free by its own sons."
kurdish officials acknowledged their announcement was prompted by turkey's growing assertiveness in northern syria.
since august, ankara has backed syrian fighters opposed to the kurds with tanks and aircraft and has bombed kurdish forces.
"let's be clear: turkey is an enemy of the kurds," said nawaf khalil, the former spokesman for syria's powerful kurdish democratic union party, known as the pyd.
"when turkey enters an area, it remains as an occupier."
the mutual distrust puts the u.s. in a difficult position as it tries to balance sdf against turkish interests in northern syria.
political official rezan hiddo said the sdf had warned the international coalition it would halt its raqqa campaign if turkish-backed forces advanced on manbij or other kurdish-held towns.
"we cannot extinguish the fire in our neighbor's house if our home is burning.
we were very clear with our allies.
if there is a plan to attack daesh, there must be limits for turkey," hiddo said, using an arabic acronym for the islamic state group.
sdf spokesman talal sillo told the associated press the raqqa campaign will occur on several fronts.
"we want to liberate the surrounding countryside, then encircle the city, then we will assault and liberate it," he said.
coalition leaders have been struggling with the timing of the raqqa campaign, not only because of the demands of the iraqi-led mosul operation but also because the political and military landscape in syria is more complicated amid a civil war that has lasted more than five years and has devastated much of the country.
lt. gen. stephen townsend, commander of anti-is coalition forces, said last week more syrian opposition fighters need to be recruited, trained and equipped for the raqqa battle.
the ypg will necessarily be part of the offensive, he said, adding: "the only force that is capable on any near-term timeline is the syrian democratic forces, of which the ypg are a significant portion."

the faded coliseum stands were filled with empty seats.
the makeshift coliseum field was filled with empty promises.
the rams reached the halfway point of their homecoming season sunday amid a stadium of boos and a city of yawns.
after a dreadful 13-10 defeat  by the carolina panthers, it is clear that los angeles’ once-darling  rams have lost far more than five of their  first eight games.
they have  lost buzz.
they have lost belief.
they have blown a blue-and-golden opportunity to fall into the open arms of a town that had been waiting 22 years for the opportunity to simply embrace them.
that town now scoffs at them.
that town now jeers at them.
in the wake of the dodgers’ success and lakers’ start, is anybody really even really talking about them?
during the slow ruination of what began as a spectacularly warm and clear autumn sunday afternoon, that embrace dissipated into a shove and a stare.
seven minutes into the game, the rams were booed.
with five minutes left,  the rams were abandoned.
by the time the rams mercifully left a field that had been sloppily painted after saturday’s usc game, they had been  whipped not only by the panthers, but also by their  inept offense, their  strange personnel decisions, and a general malaise that everyone assumed they left in st. louis.
apparently we assumed wrong.
the boos rained down in the first quarter after a pass deflection and a sack.
they continued into the second quarter as a rams offense led by quarterback case keenum sputtered.
late in the first half against the carolina panthers, some fans at the coliseum apparently could not take it any longer.
the boos rained down in the first quarter after a pass deflection and a sack.
they continued into the second quarter as a rams offense led by quarterback case keenum sputtered.
late in the first half against the carolina panthers, some fans at the coliseum apparently could not take it any longer.
“we’re just absolutely crushed,” said guard rodger saffold, afterward, shaking his head.
“enough is enough.”
enough is enough, indeed.
many in the announced crowd of 86,109 — minus bunches of no-shows — felt the same way, and were vocal about it.
the rams were booed not only because their offense is bad and boring, but also because they don’t seem to be inclined to change any of it.
they were booed, first, because they refuse to replace struggling starting quarterback case keenum with no.
1 overall draft pick jared goff, and, c’mon, this is getting ridiculous.
while fans chanted, “we want goff,” keenum overthrew brian quick for a sure touchdown pass early in the second quarter, then threw it to a leaping panther thomas davis for a third-quarter interception that led to a panthers field goal.
keenum wasn’t tall enough to avoid three tipped passes, wasn’t aware enough to find an open todd gurley on the interception, and generally failed again to muster even the most minuscule  offensive firepower that could reward the rams’ great defense.
keenum has nine touchdown passes and 11 interceptions and, really, how bad could  goff be?
at least he represents hope.
at least he’ll offer entertainment.
in him, there is at least a future.
of course, once again, rams coach jeff fisher is watching an entirely different game.
“i would submit that case is not the reason we lost this game today,” fisher said, and then stunningly noted it wasn’t even up for debate, saying, “i don’t think case’s play today was indicative of raising the question.”
photos from the rams' 13-10 loss to the carolina panthers
not even raising the question?
um, that question has already been answered.
goff should be the starting quarterback, just like  gurley should be the workhorse running back.
that’s another reason the fans booed, because the man who was supposed to be hollywood’s newest star continued to be mostly invisible and often irrelevant, gaining just 48 yards on  a dozen carries with four catches for 26 more yards.
it seemed as though after every time gurley broke free, the rams would hustle him off to the sidelines.
every time he had some momentum, his  team would steal it from him.
the crowd was briefly awakened when gurley broke off an 18-yard run  out of a wildcat formation late in the second quarter.
yet the rams followed with three consecutive passes before giving gurley the ball on fourth and one, at which point he was stopped.
then in the fourth quarter, gurley’s 10-yard run gave the rams first and goal from the carolina seven-yard line.
but sure enough, last season’s nfl offensive rookie of the year didn’t touch the ball again in that series, with three straight incomplete passes — including an end zone drop by lance kendricks — leading to a field goal that  closed the gap to 10-3.
“they’re taking the run away with respect to the fronts and the stunting, so we pick it up and throw it,” said fisher.
‘’it’s not a todd thing.”
no, indeed, it seems to be a fisher and play-caller rob boras thing, and with every loss it makes less sense.
the rams fell in love with jared goff last spring when they went to berkeley to work him out at cal.
even though it was raining, and he was given a chance to postpone, goff wanted to throw.
the foul weather didn’t scare him.
well, this is a downpour now.
after four losses in a row and the season...

“it’s not the end of the world,” said gurley.
“we just have to win games.”
it’s not the end of the world, but it’s the end of the honeymoon, and one has to wonder exactly what the rams are doing.
while other teams in los angeles understand the concept of renewal and rebirth — check out dave roberts’ dodgers and luke walton’s lakers — the rams still seem  stuck back in st. louis with lowered expectations and a mantra of mediocrity.
halfway into the first season of their return, los angeles’ oldest pro franchise appears to need new vision, new leadership … and for goodness sakes, a new quarterback.
surely this isn’t about ownership being content to tread water for three seasons until they move into the palace in inglewood, is it?
surely the rams don’t think fans will accept three seasons of this mess and then happily plunk down thousands for hot new tickets to see a tired old team.
that’s not happening in this market.
for long stretches sunday, the ancient coliseum felt like a tomb.
even playing in the powerful nfl, if the rams don’t entertain and invigorate, they will disappear not only in the shadow of the dodgers and lakers, but also usc football and the clippers.
the most penalized player in the nfl did not have a yellow flag thrown his way sunday, which was great for rams tackle greg robinson, who was beginning to think his reputation for being  too “handsy” in 2014 and 2015 was the reason he has been called for multiple holding penalties in 2016.

at this rate, they will longing for the sort of awkward exposure given to them during this summer’s “hard knocks’’ series on hbo.
remember the episode that contained fisher’s infamous rant to his team about the rams’ potential record?
“i’m not  …  going 7-9 or 8-8 or 9-7, ok?” fisher shouted.
turns out, sigh, he’s probably not.

former labour leadership candidate owen smith will seek to change legislation to allow parliament the option of holding a second eu referendum.
the pontypridd mp said the government should be able to ask people if they are certain they want to leave europe.
it comes after the high court ruled the government could not trigger article 50 without parliament's support.
prime minister theresa may has appealed the decision and the supreme court is set to hear the case in early december.
mr smith told bbc radio wales' sunday supplement programme: "i will attempt to amend the legislation such that there is an option for parliament to put it to the country that there should be a second referendum.
"now, it may not be possible to do that, the government may try and frame the bill in such a way as they make it impossible, but that will be my objective.
"that doesn't necessarily mean you have a second referendum, it may be that the terms that are negotiated are advantageous to britain.
it may be clear that the country as absolutely content with that.
"but if it becomes clear over the next two years that we are going to have greater economic uncertainty, that the country is going to be worse off and people aren't sanguine with the result, i think any sensible government would want to have, as an option in its armoury, the prospect of asking the question again in order to be certain."
if it loses its supreme court appeal over the high court's brexit ruling, it is expected that the government will have to publish some form of new law for mps - and the house of lords - to vote on.
the prime minister has vowed to carry out brexit "in full" despite the ruling and said mps should accept the referendum result.
writing in the sunday telegraph, mrs may said she was appealing against the high court decision because there was "an important principle at stake".
she said mps and peers who regret the referendum result "need to accept what the people decided" and called for unity on taking brexit forward.
labour leader jeremy corbyn has said his party would not allow article 50 to go ahead unless mrs may agreed four principles.
they include access to the single market, a commitment to eu workplace rights, guarantees on safeguarding consumers and the environment and a pledge to commit funds for any eu capital investment lost by brexit.

los angeles — marvel entertainment hates to be called a machine — the disney-owned studio thinks that term sells its filmmakers short — but a machine it truly is: with the arrival of “doctor strange” over the weekend, marvel has delivered an uninterrupted string of 13 critical and commercial hits in only eight years.
no film company, not even pixar, can claim a track record like that.
“doctor strange,” starring benedict cumberbatch as one of marvel’s lesser comic book heroes, collected an estimated $85 million at theaters in the united states and canada, according to comscore, which compiles box office data.
the movie, which received  strong reviews, cost at least $275 million to make and market worldwide.
disney said that “doctor strange” took in an additional $240.4 million overseas; imax results in china were especially robust.
with ticket sales of about $45.6 million, “trolls” took second place at the domestic box office; it was produced by dreamworks animation at a cost of $125 million and distributed by 20th century fox.
turnout for “trolls,” based on a line of wild-haired danish toys and featuring songs by justin timberlake, was on par with efforts like “the croods” and “how to train your dragon,” both of which spawned sequels.
third place went to mel gibson’s “hacksaw ridge” (lionsgate), which arrived to about $14.8 million in ticket sales, a solid total for a period-war movie from a director with a lot of personal baggage that relied heavily on grass-roots marketing.
it was independently financed for about $40 million and played mostly to older moviegoers; lionsgate said that 68 percent of the weekend audience was over the age of 35.
perhaps most notably, mr. gibson — assisted by savvy lionsgate and rogers & cowan publicists — has re-established himself as a player in hollywood after a decade when his offscreen behavior made him a movie industry pariah.
“hacksaw ridge” received mostly positive reviews and has been generating awards buzz.
a version of this article appears in print on november 7, 2016, on page c3 of the new york edition with the headline: ‘doctor strange’ is lucky 13 for marvel hit machine.

the nbc news release for monday’s “the 2016 s.n.l.
election special,” which will compile recent “saturday night live” political sketches, promises to “retrace the highlights of the current presidential campaign.”
that’s the first joke right there: that any part of this exhausting, acrimonious, soul-killing campaign can be considered a highlight.
as alec baldwin put it, breaking character as donald j. trump on the last saturday before the election: “don’t you guys feel gross all the time about this?”
but it’s undeniable that the race has blessed “s.n.l.” with material.
and cursed it.
“s.n.l.” faced near-impossible expectations: first, to wring laughs out of a national nervous breakdown, and second, to improve on a political reality so self-spoofing that it writes its own penis jokes.
“s.n.l.” couldn’t manage that, at least when it’s taken the candidates head on.
but it’s done some fine work around the election’s edges.
“s.n.l.” is a mainstream media institution, no less than “meet the press” or the presidential debates.
(we’ve had televised general-election debates on a regular basis only since 1976, a year after “s.n.l.” started.)
so there’s a kind of dutifulness to its election satire, which unfolds with all the ritual merriment of a candidates’ pancake toss at a state fair.
advertisement
the big change the show made this fall was to bring in mr. baldwin to pinch-hit.
his boorish trump felt like penance for “s.n.l.” having let the candidate guest-host the show last november during the republican primary campaign, and maybe for nbcuniversal’s larger entanglements with him — the former “apprentice” host, sucked up to by billy bush, coddled by matt lauer, patted like an apricot sheepdog by jimmy fallon.
was mr. baldwin’s trump good?
mimetically, it was worthy of a biopic.
if i try to visualize mr. trump from the debates now, i see mr. baldwin instead, hulking, heavy-breathing, his lips pursed open like the suckers of some deep-sea creature.
but there wasn’t a distinctive spin on mr. trump as a character, the way kate mckinnon developed her hillary clinton long ago into a savage yet sympathetic portrait of political thirst.
the scripts mainly highlighted moments, like mr. trump’s lurking in the second debate, that the writers’ room of twitter had already hashed out in real time.
like any establishment institution, the show is prey to conventional wisdom.
after the “access hollywood” trump tape, “s.n.l.” followed mainstream pundits’ conclusion that the election was over.
the second-debate sketch introduced the democratic candidate as “president hillary clinton,” and mr. baldwin’s trump declared, “i’m going to huff, i’m going to puff, and i’m going to blow this whole thing.”
(this, by the way, was the episode that enraged the real mr. trump on twitter — “alec baldwin portrayal stinks.
media rigging election!” — and if the past year and a half taught us anything, it was being treated as a loser, not mr. baldwin’s huffing and puffing, that set him off.)
the show hasn’t been able to one-up mr. trump’s real-life caricature, but then, neither has the rest of late-night comedy.
he’s been a pulsating orange sun that blinds any comedian who stares at it directly.
which may be why “s.n.l.” has been most effective when it’s looked past the candidates.
“celebrity family feud: political edition” sketched the motley circus of surrogates and campaign allies, including ivanka trump (margot robbie, her hair apparently blown by an offscreen fan), a vampiric vladimir putin (beck bennett) and bill clinton (darrell hammond, slipping on the role like an old sweatshirt).
the taped short “a day off” imagined mr. trump’s campaign manager, kellyanne conway (ms. mckinnon), having a free day interrupted by repeated calls to defend the indefensible on cnn.
(“of course mr. trump thinks that mexicans can read, and actually what he wants them to read the most is hillary clinton’s 33,000’s missing emails” — an only slightly exaggerated version of a familiar deny-pivot-attack ballet.)
by far the season’s peak was an installment of the returning quiz-show sketch, “black jeopardy!,” with tom hanks as doug, a trump supporter, answering african-american-themed questions against two black contestants (sasheer zamata and leslie jones).
advertisement
doug, to everyone’s shock, got one response after another right.
prompted with the answer, “they out here saying, the new iphone wants your thumbprint ‘for your protection,’” he answered, “what is: ‘i don’t think so.
that’s how they get you.’”
the host (kenan thompson) was surprised — “yes!” — even relieved.
this blue-collar white guy was on the same wavelength as his black guests, suspicious of authority, anxious to make ends meet, unimpressed with skinny women.
it was cathartic, almost moving.
despite all the vitriol out there, maybe they weren’t all that different?
then came the final category: “lives that matter.” said the host, “well, it was good while it lasted, doug.”
this wasn’t just the best sketch of the “s.n.l.” election season.
it was some of the best political analysis of the campaign, making a nuanced point about white trump supporters and minorities, race and economic anxiety.
doug and his black counterparts, it said, have real issues in common — and a real, ultimate difference they may not be able to get past.
the final cold open with mr. baldwin and ms. mckinnon likewise turned its focus from the candidates to us.
it started in straight campaign mode, portraying mr. trump being supported by the f.b.i., mr. putin and the ku klux klan while cnn obsessed over mrs. clinton’s email.
then the two actors broke off, declared that they were tired of hurling insults, and ran into the streets of manhattan to hug passers-by, before returning to urge the audience, in ms. mckinnon’s words, to “choose what kind of country we want to live in.”
this too was a staged bit.
but it also felt like a concession.
the election, it said, has taxed the limits of typical election comedy, of he-said, she-said poking at foibles.
it’s become an emotionally draining, terrifying, zero-sum culture war into which we’ve been drafted.
it was hardly the most hilarious election sketch “s.n.l.” has ever done.
but it may have been the right place, this year, to stop: peering beyond the vanishing edge of satire to the point at which all this stuff is no longer funny.

a major u.s.-backed offensive to oust isis from its capital of raqqa, syria has begun, it was announced early sunday.
the kurdish-dominated syria democratic forces (sdf) coalition told a news conference that the goal of the operation, called angry euphrates, would be liberating the syrian city from the militants.

the offensive, which comes two weeks after a campaign to clear isis from mosul, iraq, will be supported by u.s. air strikes and involved 30,000 fighters, the sdf told reporters.
residents in the city were warned to stay away from gathering places as those will be targets during the operation.
the u.k-based syrian observatory for human rights said fighter jets believed to be from the u.s.-led coalition carried out airstrikes in in the
warplanes believed to belong to the international coalition bombed places controlled by the "islamic state" in laqta area to the northeast of al raqqah but there was no immediate word on casualties.
the move to liberate raqqa was signaled at the end of last month by defense secretary ash carter in an interview in paris with nbc news.
the city is the de facto capital of the extremists' so-called caliphate which stretches from syria into iraq.

samsung electronics said sunday it will offer an artificial intelligence assistant service in the upcoming flagship smartphone, as the south korean firm seeks recovery from its global smartphone recalls.
the galaxy s8 will let users order food or perform other tasks without going through a third-party application but by simply asking the phone's virtual assistant, samsung said in a statement.
the artificial intelligence service will also be made available in samsung's other consumer electronics products, such as refrigerators.
the company declined to disclose what specific tasks the s8 phone will perform through its artificial intelligence feature.
samsung is expected to unveil the next iteration for its flagship galaxy device in spring as it has typically done in the past.
sales of the galaxy s8 will be crucial for the recovery of samsung's mobile business, which saw its latest quarterly profit nearly wiped out by two global recalls of the galaxy note 7 smartphone.
samsung estimates it has lost at least $5.3 billion as it discontinued the model, which overheated and caught fire.
the company said last month that it has not figured out what went wrong with the note 7 phones.
the south korean company joined the race to create the digital assistant service when it acquired in october viv labs inc., a silicon valley startup launched by the same entrepreneurs who sold siri to apple.
past and current samsung phones offer a voice assistant service called "s voice" developed internally, but the feature did not gain much traction.
samsung and apple still rule tablet market
the two electronics giants still dominate the space as overall shipments remain sluggish.
samsung's acquisition of the silicon valley firm was seen as its taking another step to seek independence from google, which offers its brand of virtual assistant service in android-powered devices.
executives at samsung and viv labs said that the biggest difference between the existing digital assistant and the one they are jointly developing is that the latter will be an "open ai platform," meaning that third-party developers will be able to offer their services through samsung's ai platform.
"our galaxy smartphones don't provide services that enable consumers to order pizza or coffee, but does provide third party applications.
but the new ai platform will enable consumers to do things that they would usually do through a separate third party application," samsung's statement said.

it is almost a year to the day since jürgen klopp stared in disbelief at liverpool fans streaming out of anfield before the end of a defeat by crystal palace.
no one quits early any more.
with his side top of the premier league and turning on the style on a weekly basis, these are the days for liverpool to savour.
watford were not simply the fifth of six visitors beaten at anfield this season but the latest team to feel and suffer the punishing effect of the formidable attack constructed by klopp.
walter mazzarri’s side came with a proud defensive record to protect.
it was obliterated inside 45 minutes as liverpool swarmed to the premier league summit for the first time since may 2014 with the kind of performance that suggests they might enjoy the view for a good while yet.
doubts may well surround liverpool’s defensive ability at set pieces but there was not a soul inside anfield who would complain at getting first place and one intense attacking display after another in exchange.
once again, the incomparable front trident of sadio mané, philippe coutinho and roberto firmino punctured holes in the opposition backline.
all three were on the scoresheet and liverpool were three up before the break as watford wilted under relentless pressure.
the only surprise was that the visitors’ record of not conceding a premier league goal stretched to five hours and 25 minutes as liverpool had eight presentable chances to score before mané commenced the onslaught with a cute header.
the senegal international scored the fifth, too, before being substituted to a standing ovation.
“if we still had suárez,” the kop sang, “he’d be on the bench.” that may have been tongue in cheek but the tribute to liverpool’s collective power was merited.
they have witnessed 13 different goalscorers in 14 matches this season and 10 in the premier league alone.
watford also lost heurelho gomes to what appeared a serious injury to the goalkeeper’s right knee on a galling afternoon for the men from vicarage road.
they would have been behind early had firmino, lucas leiva – deputising for the ill dejan lovren in central defence – or coutinho not missed clear openings.
confirming liverpool’s threat is not confined to the front three, emre can and james milner also had sight of gomes’s goal before the dam burst.
mané was involved in almost every liverpool break in the first half.
he broke the deadlock when daryl janmaat switched off at a short corner between milner and coutinho, enabling the former southampton forward to steal a yard on the defender and steer the brazilian’s cross home with his head.
three minutes later it was two as nathaniel clyne, mané, adam lallana and firmino combined to invite coutinho to attack watford’s central defence.
liverpool’s no10 duly obliged, cutting on to his right and driving a powerful low shot through the legs of younès kaboul and into the centre of the visitors’ goal.
gomes was unsighted but also beaten easily as his knee gave way while attempting to correct his body shape.
the keeper was helped off in clear distress by two members of watford’s medical staff.
“it was a very bad knock but we won’t know how bad it is until he has been checked in the next days,” said the defeated manager.
can put the game beyond mazzarri’s team before half-time when he read lallana’s deep cross to perfection and headed the ball back across gomes’s replacement, costel pantilimon, at the far post.
it could have been four in the first half but for pantilimon tipping away a milner free-kick that looked destined for the top corner.
number four did arrive from another flowing move, lallana sweeping a low cross along the six-yard box for firmino to convert at close range, before the brazilian turned provider to set up mané’s second of the game.
jordan henderson released firmino clear on the right after winning a clearance from pantilimon, he looked up, surveyed his options and rolled a perfect ball on to mané’s run for the striker to beat the keeper convincingly.
to their credit, watford did not take the hammering lying down and loris karius had to produce the first impressive saves of his anfield career from étienne capoue and miguel britos before janmaat, in acres of space inside the liverpool area, steered a consolation into the far corner.
but there was never any chance of klopp’s side easing off.
daniel sturridge twice struck the crossbar after coming on for lallana and it was his shot, parried by pantilimon, that enabled his fellow substitute georginio wijnaldum to score his first liverpool goal from the rebound.
six goals and at number one.
klopp surveys a new main stand when he turns around to check for any early leavers these days.
there is also a different team in front of him and different belief around him.
liverpool will take some stopping.
trump’s campaign says clinton ‘hitting the panic button’ in blue states as candidates set out on whirlwind final 48 hours of bitterly fought election

hillary clinton and donald trump are sprinting towards the finish line of the most bitter, divisive and fear-tainted us presidential election of modern times, with polls showing clinton has the edge.
seeking to become the first female president, the democrat will end her campaign with a rally in the battleground state of north carolina at midnight on monday.
republican candidate trump will close his at 11pm that night with an event in grand rapids, michigan, a state where he is hoping to pull off a huge surprise.
around a third of ballots – at least 41m across 48 states – have been cast in early voting, according to the associated press, and the election still appears to be clinton’s to lose.
on sunday, she led trump 48%-43% in a washington post/abc tracking poll, 44%-40% in an nbc/wall street journal poll and 45%-42% in a politico/morning consult poll.
clinton received a boost on sunday afternoon, with the release of a letter to congress from fbi director james comey that said the bureau had found no evidence of wrongdoing by clinton in its review of emails discovered during an investigation into charges against anthony weiner, estranged husband of key aide huma abedin.
the fbi review related to clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state, an issue over which the bureau had previously decided not to recommend an indictment.
nonetheless, data suggest clinton is not as strongly placed in electoral college projections as barack obama was at the same stage in 2012.
clinton is not “in a terribly safe position”, leading pollster nate silver of fivethirtyeight told abc’s this week on sunday.
“the electoral map is actually less solid for clinton than it was for obama four years ago.”
the two candidates have fought an ugly battle to become the 45th president, dogged by controversies ranging from fbi investigation into clinton’s email use to sexual assault allegations against trump.
clinton would be the first spouse of a president to reach the white house.
trump, at 70, would be the oldest person to assume the office.
as both candidates and their surrogates set out on a whirlwind final 48 hours on the trail, the wild card nature of trump’s candidacy made the map harder to read than usual.
among 10 rallies planned over the last two days were stops in minnesota, which has not supported a republican presidential nominee since 1972, and michigan, which has not gone to the gop since 1988.
clinton, however, lost both states to bernie sanders in the democratic primary.
van jones, a former adviser to obama, told cnn’s state of the union: “beds are damp.
there is a crack in the blue wall and it has to do with trade.
this is the ghost of bernie sanders.”
the trump campaign claimed “an enormous surge in momentum and enthusiasm” in recent days, citing minnesota, where the campaign said that in less than 24 hours it had 18,000 rsvps for a event that could hold 5,000 people.
it now sees “at least six different paths” to victory, aides said.
dave bossie, deputy campaign manager, told reporters: “we have expanded the map.
we are on offence.
we are going to places no one thought we would.
it’s an incredibly exciting time for our campaign.
hillary clinton is on defence and her map is shrinking.
we feel we are peaking at the right time as a campaign.”
clinton has led every poll in michigan but she, obama and bill clinton were all due to appear there before the vote.
trump campaign manager kellyanne conway said such major political figures were now playing “follow your leader” in traditional democratic states.
“we feel very good about the fact that we’re actually setting the landscape here and they’re chasing us around in these blue states,” she said.
“we have seen our prospects improving in michigan for quite a while now internally and we do see that now reflected in some of the public polling.
we also like what we hear on the ground in michigan ... and we trust the savviness and brilliance of the clinton campaign.
“if they thought michigan was in the bag, hillary clinton, bill clinton and barack obama would not be returning there today or tomorrow.”
democrats insisted that was because there is no early voting in the state, so they want to fire up the base.
clinton campaign chair john podesta told nbc’s meet the press: “if we hold on to nevada, if we hold on to michigan, then hillary clinton is going to be the next president of america.
“most people vote on election day in michigan, so our schedule has been oriented toward being in the early vote states in the earlier period of time.
we feel like we’ve got a lead in michigan.
we want to hold on to it, and we think we can do that.”
trump has been widely condemned as a demagogue after calling for a temporary ban on muslims entering the us and promising to build a wall on the mexican border, branding immigrants as rapists and criminals.
a 2005 video recording emerged in which he bragged about groping women, after which a dozen women came forward with claims of sexual assault and harassment.
he has been ostracised by key members of his own party.
the final days of his campaign were marked by a raucous incident in a rally in reno on saturday night, as secret service agents rushed the candidate from the stage.
a protester named austyn crites who was holding a “republicans against trump” sign apparently sparked the confused scene.
crites told the guardian trump supporters attacked him after he walked to the front of the rally and held up the sign.
eventually, someone shouted “gun”, which led to law enforcement rushing trump from the stage and briefly detaining crites.
conway said on sunday: “we’re told that he is a ‘republican’ who has canvassed for hillary clinton and donated money to her campaign.”
crites told the guardian he was a republican and fiscal conservative but had canvassed “for a few hours” with the clinton campaign in nevada, because he wanted to do all he could to prevent a trump presidency.
he described trump as “a textbook version of a dictator and a fascist”.
trump’s son, donald jr, and dan scavino, who runs his social media operation, retweeted a message that read: “hillary ran away from rain today.
trump is back on stage minutes after assassination attempt”.
no weapon was found.
although trump rallies have long been marked by violence and unrest, they had been comparatively peaceful in recent months as the candidate has become increasingly scripted.
rhetorically, trump has turned his ire on celebrity clinton supporters jay z and beyoncé.
“i don’t need beyoncé and i don’t need jay z,” he declared in a denver rodeo barn.
he also criticised jay z for lyrics in some of the songs performed at his friday night concert for clinton in cleveland in the battleground state of ohio.
“my language is nothing to compared to what jay z was doing last night and beyoncé,” trump said, adding: “my language is like baby talk.”
clinton has appeared with other celebrities, including jennifer lopez, katy perry and jon bon jovi.
at a get-out-the-vote concert on saturday night, perry told roughly 10,000 fans in philadelphia her parents were lifelong republicans.
“but it’s not about where you come from, it’s about what you grow into,” she said.
trump also made his first explicit accusations of voter fraud in the 2016 election.
only minutes before the incident that caused secret service agents to rush him from the stage in reno, he claimed: “it’s being reported certain key democratic polling locations in clark county were kept open hours and hours beyond closing time to bus and bring democratic voters in.
“folks, it’s a rigged system, it’s a rigged system,” he added, to loud boos, before insisting: “we’re going to beat it.”
he was apparently referring to a las vegas supermarket where voters, most of whom were hispanic, stood in line for hours to vote on friday night.
the length of lines meant that the early voting site did not close until 10pm.
trump’s words echoed allegations by michael mcdonald, the chair of the nevada republican party, who claimed before trump took the stage: “last night in clark county, they kept a poll open until 10 o’clock at night so a certain group can vote … you feel free right now?
you think this is a free and easy election?”
the republican nominee has long made broad, baseless and vague accusations of “large-scale voter fraud”.
at the final presidential debate, he declined to say whether he would accept the result of the election.
on sunday, his vice-presidential candidate, mike pence, told fox news sunday: “the campaign has made it very clear that a clear outcome, obviously, both sides will accept.
but i think both campaigns have also been very clear that in the event of disputed results, they reserve all rights and remedies.”
after the frantic final 48 hours on the trail, both clinton and trump will be in new york city on election night, with the democrats having reportedly booked a firework display and the tycoon billing his planned event at a hotel as a “victory party”.
conway said: “we did not purchase fireworks because we’re planning for a victory but we’re working really hard toward it and not just assuming it.”
hsbc reported a sharper-than-expected 86 percent fall in pretax profit for the third quarter as the british lender booked a $1.7 billion loss on the sale of its brazilian unit and it was also hit by adverse foreign currency movements.
the bank's reported pretax profit was $843 million in the september quarter, down from $6.1 billion in the same period a year ago, hsbc said in a hong kong stock exchange filing on monday.
that was much lower than estimates of $2.45 billion, based on the average of analysts' forecasts compiled by the bank.
hsbc is the last major britain-based lender to report third-quarter earnings, after lloyds, barclays and rbs all showed signs of coping better than expected in the aftermath of britain's vote to leave the eu.
adjusted pretax profit, excluding the one-time charges, rose 7 percent during the quarter to $5.6 billion, helped by increased revenue from its global banking and markets business, which houses its investment bank, hsbc said.
its london-listed shares were higher by nearly 5 percent by 11:00 a.m. london time.
the bank said the main differences between reported and adjusted profits are foreign currency translation costs, and significant items, including the operating results for its brazil business as well as the loss recognized on disposal.
hsbc earlier this year sold its brazil unit in a $5.2 billion deal.
the lender's core capital ratio, a key measure of financial strength, rose to 13.9 percent at the end of the september quarter from 12.1 percent at end-june, bolstered by a change in the "regulatory treatment" of its investment in china's bank of communications, ceo stuart gulliver said in a statement.
"this is another action forming part of our ongoing capital management of the group that reinforces our ability to support the dividend, to invest in the business and, over the medium term, to contemplate share buy-backs, as appropriate," he said.
"it also provides us with a significant capacity to manage the continuing uncertain regulatory environment."
hsbc's hong kong-listed shares extended gains to trade up about 2.5 percent after the results by 0514 gmt on monday, compared with the broader hong kong stock market's 0.6 percent gain.

the fbi director has faced loud criticism over his handling of the clinton email investigation.
regardless of who wins the election, he is poised to pay a price
spencer ackerman
sunday 6 november 2016 23.32 gmt

hillary clinton’s immediate fbi woes ended on sunday with a letter whose five sentences signaled that james comey’s troubles have only begun.
the director of the fbi has come under withering, escalating and relentless criticism since he sent congress a vague letter, on 28 october, heralding a potential re-examination of the investigation into clinton’s private email server.
the original inquiry ended in july, after months of officials scouring clinton’s communications while secretary of state, with the conclusion that her practices were “extremely careless” but not criminal.
on sunday, comey brought what many viewed as a frightening fbi intervention into a presidential election to a close.
the democratic presidential nominee will not face an fbi recommendation for indictment over her stewardship of classified information.
whether or not comey endangered his position at the head of the fbi, the episode has cost him his chief asset: his reputation, cultivated assiduously in the media, for probity and judgment.
beyond the director himself, the coda to the clinton email inquiry has exposed the fbi as a politicized agency, a development with serious repercussions over the next several years.
donald trump spent much of the summer and fall attacking the fbi as “corrupt” for failing to recommend indictment, only to reverse himself entirely after comey’s october letter.
now that comey has ended the issue ahead of the election, the director has demonstrated himself to be an unreliable ally to trump, who has loudly insisted on complete loyalty around him.
should trump win the election, comey is likely to find himself either marginalized or unemployed.
if clinton wins, comey’s position is unlikely to be much better.
sources within the fbi have pointed to a deep, visceral antipathy to clinton within the bureau, as well as substantial support for trump.
comey’s earlier decision to publicly recommend no charges had spurred anger among fbi employees disposed negatively toward her, and comey’s newest letter changes none of that sentiment.
now comey has restored that status quo ante, again frustrating anti-clinton sentiments in his workforce.
this time, however, he has seen his allies in washington abandon him, depriving comey of a bulwark against his rank-and-file.
the loss of that bulwark is critical, and will likely become visible in the near future.
beyond the email inquiry, the fbi also has had the clinton foundation, the family’s charity, under some form of scrutiny.
once again, comey is in a bind.
fbi sources have already leaked that allegations against the foundation are weak, given their source in a book by a far-right author who provides little evidence.
should the fbi fail to recommend another indictment, trump’s voters and congressional republicans will presume bias in the bureau – particularly since those republicans have already stated intentions to keep a hypothetical clinton white house under persistent investigation.
should the fbi recommend indictment, clinton’s voters and congressional democrats will presume comey acted for political reasons, or caved to such motives within the bureau.
comey may very soon himself be under investigation.
al franken, a minnesota senator on the judiciary committee with direct oversight of the fbi, said early sunday he was “certain” of forthcoming hearings into comey’s actions.
after the latest letter, senator dianne feinstein, another judiciary committee democrat and a consistent ally of the security agencies, said she found comey’s intervention “even more troubling”.
feinstein also called for a justice department review.
clinton herself has pointedly declined to say whether she would retain comey if she is elected.
she too faces a political dilemma, even in the event of victory on tuesday, since firing comey could turn the director into a martyr for opponents on the right.
clinton’s chief aides are notorious for their long memories, however, and her white house would likely view the fbi as a threat, or at least with extreme distrust.
her appointment of an attorney general would consequently fall under intense questioning about any tacit mandate to contain the bureau.
comey’s political imbroglio coincides with his attempt to persuade congress that sophisticated commercial encryption poses a security threat.
he has now lost his chief weapon in that debate, the benefit of the doubt: fbi intervention into a presidential election has made fears of an assertive law enforcement and intelligence agency deciding the national agenda more salient than any pr campaign from privacy advocates ever could.
it is a spectacular fall for comey.
he built his public persona as the man who stood up to pressure from george w bush’s white house over mass surveillance.
the real story, hidden from public view until edward snowden’s leaks, showed comey to be significantly less heroic, but the persona was enough to persuade barack obama to elevate him to run the fbi weeks after the guardian began publishing material snowden disclosed.
after comey picked a fight with apple over encryption and lost, his judgment appeared shaky.
now comey has committed an unforced error that has drained his reservoir of goodwill in washington.
with the fbi’s integrity in the balance, comey faces several difficult months, if not years, in washington, regardless of the country’s vote in two days.
hillary clinton, lifted by support from college-educated and non-white voters, holds a clear but narrow lead over donald trump  in the final nbc news/wall street journal poll before tuesday's election.
clinton draws 44 percent support from likely voters to 40 percent for trump, 6 percent for libertarian candidate gary johnson, and 2 percent for green party candidate jill stein.
her four-percentage point advantage exceeds the survey's margin for error of 2.73 percentage points.
the democratic nominee's lead has diminished sharply from the 11 percentage point edge she held in the previous nbc/wsj poll, taken in mid-october after the second of three presidential debates.
but the underlying patterns of support for the two contenders — by gender, race, education, and age — remains the same.
trump leads by eight percentage points among men, but clinton commands a larger 13 percentage point advantage among women.
trump leads by 16 percentage points among whites, but clinton leads by 75 percentage points among african-americans and 42 percentage points among hispanics.
the billionaire developer's eight percentage point lead among voters age 65 or older is not enough to offset the former secretary of state's edge with younger voters.
the poll shows her ahead by 16 percentage points among voters aged 18-34, and by two points among those aged 35-64.
among income groups, clinton leads by 14 points among those earning less than $30,000, seven points among those earning $30,000-$50,000, and eight points among those earning from $50,000-$75,000.
trump holds a slim three point edge among those earning more than $75,00
by regions, clinton holds double-digit advantages in the northeast and the west.
the two candidates break even in the midwest, while trump holds a seven-point edge in the south.
while they split the vote in suburbs, clinton maintains a 26-percentage point edge in urban areas that outweighs trump's 28-point edge in the rural vote, which represents a smaller portion of the electorate.
the telephone survey of 1,282 likely voters was conducted nov. 3-5.

shortly before the election, the fbi has become a lightning rod for controversy.
during this time, the bureau has gone through the most public humiliation in its history.
on sunday, fbi director james comey told us lawmakers that no charges would be filed against hillary clinton, the democratic nominee, for her handling of classified information.
he was trying to put an end to rumours about what might happen to her - and restore the reputation of the bureau.
he has a lot of work to do.
the tone of his announcement on sunday was measured.
but the timing, two days before the election, made him and his colleagues seem panicked - and worried about their own future.
however measured, these were the words of an fbi director in damage-control mode.
comey was trying to make up for past mistakes - and contain fallout from his earlier remarks.
on 28 october, he sent a letter to several congressional committees, informing them that investigators had come across new information that could involve clinton's use of a private server.
that letter was a bombshell, lobbed in the midst of an intensely savage presidential campaign - in a nation ripped apart by partisan politics.
it was followed by leaks, rumours and ferocious attacks by staffers from both campaigns, democratic and republican - many involving the bureau.
even those who love the bureau and admire its director have been troubled by the way it has gotten caught up in politics.
in some accounts at least, the fbi has been cast as a place full of trump supporters who are trying to sabotage clinton's campaign.
but the assumptions about their political views may be misguided.
some people at the fbi like trump.
but many do not.
in a broader sense, people in the intelligence community have been wary of him.
one of them told me that if trump were elected - and appoints one of his key advisors, michael flynn to a high-level intelligence position - there will be a "mass exodus" of officers and analysts.
regardless of their politics, the people who work at the bureau still support comey.
he remains popular.
but they also wish the problems would go away - and that the election would be over.
the problems date back to july.
back then comey told congress he did not believe clinton should face prosecution for mishandling classified information.
then investigators started to gather information about a separate case, involving anthony weiner, a former us congressman who's married to huma abedin, an aide to clinton.
(weiner is now separated from abedin.)
the investigators were trying to find out information about weiner and illicit messages he apparently sent to an underage girl.
during their search, they came across material they thought deserved a closer look.
comey wanted to make the process as transparent as possible, say his friends and relatives.
that's why he told congress about the developments.
"he's a very decent man," said stephen saltzburg, a former senior justice department official.
"but i think he made a mistake."
"comey dug himself into a hole," said spike bowman, a former assistant general counsel at the fbi.
"he's trying to figure out a way to get out of it."
many people said they were glad comey chose to inform congress about the developments in the investigation as they happened.
they thought that voters should know about them.
others said that releasing information about the investigation violated justice department rules about not interfering in an election.
"days before the election, public discussion is dominated by actions that the fbi director took.
that is improper," said steven aftergood, the director of the project on government secrecy for the federation of american scientists.
aftergood said that comey may have had good intentions.
still, said aftergood: "his actions were destructive."
comey knows that, and has been scrambling to minimise the destruction.
investigators at the fbi sifted through the additional emails - vast amounts of material - in a surprisingly short time.
then comey made his latest announcement.
rumours are still flying, though, and voters are trying to make sense of things.

volkswagen says german prosecutors have widened their investigation of the emissions scandal to include the chairman of the company's board of directors.
hans dieter poetsch was vw's chief financial officer when the company's scandal over cars rigged to cheat on u.s. diesel emissions tests broke in september 2015.
volkswagen said in a statement sunday that prosecutors in the german city of braunschweig are investigating two members of the board including poetsch, but didn't name the second person.
prosecutors were already investigating former volkswagen ceo martin winterkorn and another unnamed executive over allegations they didn't inform investors soon enough.
vw said "based on careful examination by internal and external legal experts," the company reaffirms its belief that board members fulfilled their disclosure obligation under germany's capital markets law.

on the eve of the presidential election, hillary clinton appears to be opening up some daylight between her and donald trump in the final round of national opinion surveys.
this shouldn't come as a total surprise, since a glance at the past six months of polls show that every time it looks like mr trump is going to surpass his democratic opponent in the standings, the trend reverses itself.
the american people, perhaps, could never quite get their heads around the prospect of a trump presidency, and countervailing forces asserted themselves every time it looks like that might be a reality.
if that's the case here, then the timing may be just right for a comfortable clinton win.
none of the polls, of course, take account of how voters are reacting to the fbi clearing clinton of criminality on the latest batch of emails.
here's my blog on how that twist may impact the election.
who is ahead in the polls?
48%
hillary clinton
44%
donald trump
last updated november 8, 2016
these are the latest predictions from the number crunchers at some us media:
new york times upshot: clinton has 84% chance of winning
fivethirtyeight: clinton has 65% chance
huffpost: clinton has 98% chance
of course, the us election isn't won based on national preferences, it's a state-by-state slog to reach 270 electoral votes.
the latest round of battleground polling shows there are still just enough toss-up states to allow mr trump to win the presidency.
to prevail the republican would have to either clear the table when it comes to these states or post a surprise win in a place like pennsylvania, michigan or virginia, where polling shows mrs clinton ahead.
such a shoot-the-moon scenario is certainly possible, and it could be aided by polling that underestimates white voter turnout or overestimates mrs clinton's support in key constituencies like blacks and the young.
for this to become a reality, however, mr trump would essentially have to be perfect or polling would have to be off in a variety of disparate states that have decidedly different electorates.
an error in new hampshire polling, for instance, wouldn't mean expectations in florida would be more likely to be wrong.
a miss in michigan would have little bearing on the fate of colorado.
mr trump would also have to count on the evidence of massive hispanic turnout in early voting not panning out when votes are counted on tuesday night.
heading into election day, the clinton team has reason for cautious optimism.
a trump win at this point would have to be considered a modest (but far from unprecedented) upset.

andy murray celebrated his elevation to world no1 by winning the paris masters in three tense sets against john isner here on sunday, extending his lead over novak djokovic at the top of the rankings to a slender 405 points.
but, ever the realist, he knows that might not be a plump enough cushion on which to rest his new crown for very long.
if djokovic overcomes the disturbing ennui that enveloped him when he fell in the quarter-finals at bercy on friday and recovers from a lingering injury to his right arm to win every match and hold his title at the atp world tour finals in london, starting next monday, he will resume a reign that had stretched to 122 weeks.
it is murray’s fresh challenge, after beating isner 6-3, 6-7 (4-7), 6-4 in the final, to ensure that does not happen.
“i want to keep going,” murray said courtside.
“it’s been a great year and i want to finish as well as i can.
i’m not so much thinking about finishing as the world no1.
i just want to play well at the o2.
i’ve not always played well there and i want to do myself justice.
i’ll get a few days’ rest now.”
complicating the equation, however, murray will lose 275 points after the finals, because great britain failed to retain the davis cup they won last november.
one way he can hold djokovic at bay is to beat him in the o2 final; it would be the perfect finish to what has been the best season of his career.
for now the scot wants to enjoy the high point of a journey that began 11 years ago and which he dare not contemplate until it was sealed in bizarre circumstances after milos raonic’s late withdrawal from their semi-final with a quad injury on saturday.
murray did not need to win the title to retain his newly acquired ranking, as he had a slender five-point lead over djokovic, but losing has never been a palatable option for him – especially against isner, whom he has now beaten eight times in a row and who has broken murray’s serve only once in 40 attempts.
the american did well to force a third set when he won the second-set tie-break, but he could not hold murray off at the finish, a final volley catching the net flush after two hours and 17 minutes.
it was murray’s eighth title of the year and his 18th win in a row.
isner paid murray a glowing tribute on court.
“i have to congratulate andy, first for the title and also for [being] no1 in the world.
that is an incredible achievement.
every week i’m in the same locker room and i see how much work you put in.
you absolutely deserve it.”
murray takes home his eighth masters title, with only indian wells and monte carlo left.
he has won 60 of 65 matches since may.
“[it was] very satisfying,” murray said.
“it was an unbelievably hard match today.
john came up with some great volleys.
i was just lucky he hit a few [poor] serves in the last game and i managed to hit some good passing shots.
i wasn’t getting many opportunities.
i actually felt pretty good, as i was nervous before the match.
i had never won here before, never got past the quarter-finals.”

thousands protested in hong kong on sunday against what they consider a legal overreach by beijing, with some demonstrators clashing with the police.
hong kong — thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of hong kong on sunday, clashing with the police in a protest against an impending decision by china’s parliament aimed at eradicating a nascent independence movement in the territory.
in a scene that resembled the enormous pro-democracy demonstrations of 2014, the police used pepper spray to push back hundreds of protesters gathering after nightfall around the chinese government’s liaison office in the city.
protesters defended themselves with umbrellas, many of them yellow — the symbol of the 2014 umbrella movement — and set up barricades across a major street.
sunday’s march occurred before a decision expected on monday by the national people’s congress in china that is intended to ensure that two young people elected in september to hong kong’s 70-seat legislature never formally take office.
advertisement
the two, yau wai-ching, 25, and sixtus leung, 30, support independence for hong kong.
both inserted what many consider to be a derogatory term for china into their oaths of office last month, and both were told that they must retake their oaths.
their words incited fury in beijing, which has used its large internal police force to stamp out separatist movements in places like tibet and xinjiang.

a commentator in the communist party’s official people’s daily newspaper called ms. yau’s and mr. leung’s actions a “festering pustule” on wednesday.
on saturday, the standing committee of the national people’s congress declared the two a threat to national security.
but in hong kong, unlike in tibet and xinjiang, the power of china’s authoritarian government is constrained.
here, civil liberties are guaranteed by the city’s mini-constitution, known as the basic law, and an international treaty that paved the way for britain to hand over sovereignty of the territory, a former colony, to china in 1997.
in a sign of how seriously it views the situation with the lawmakers, china is taking the extraordinary step of interpreting a clause in the basic law in such a way that is expected to make it impossible for ms. yau and mr. leung to retake their oaths and formally assume office.
a decision may come on monday.
it would be only the second time since 1997 that the national people’s congress had intervened in hong kong without being asked by the territory’s government or its highest court.
such an intervention into a sophisticated legal system inherited from the british and based on hundred of years of legal precedents has alarmed many people in hong kong.
china has the right to issue interpretations of the basic law, but the hong kong bar association said on wednesday that a decision by beijing would “deal a severe blow” to the judicial independence of hong kong’s courts, which are adjudicating ms. yau and mr. leung’s case.
advertisement
many fear that the move will further undermine the principle of “one country, two systems,” which has given the city considerable autonomy.
beijing’s impending move has galvanized the large coalition of protesters who captured the world’s attention during their 79-day occupation of major thoroughfares in hong kong in late 2014.
they fear that the communist party will not only invalidate the elections of ms. yau and mr. leung, but also move against other major figures of the protests who were voted into office in september.
“when hong kong’s basic law can be changed at the communist party’s will, what does that say about hong kong’s future?” said joshua wong, 20, the most prominent leader of the 2014 protests.
“today, it could disqualify the pro-independence legislators,” he said, wearing a surgical mask and plastic goggles as he stood in the middle of the demonstration.
“who would be next?”
as midnight approached in hong kong, hundreds of protesters remained in a tense standoff with the police near china’s liaison office.
officers stood in a row, armed with truncheons and shields.
some had gas masks, raising concerns that tear gas could be used.
it was the use of tear gas against the unarmed protesters in 2014 that helped set off that year’s widespread protest movement.
after midnight, officers in riot gear began clearing the area of protesters, some of whom were shouting, “hong kong independence.”
the 2014 protests followed a decision by the national people’s congress that also generated outrage in hong kong.
that year, the communist party-controlled body set strict rules on planned elections for hong kong’s top leader that effectively gave beijing control over who could be nominated for the office.
a version of this article appears in print on november 7, 2016, on page a1 of the new york edition with the headline: china says 2 can’t take office.

trump not satisfied with fbi review of clinton emails
donald trump questions the thoroughness of the fbi's review of newly discovered hillary clinton emails.
donald trump on sunday reacted to the fbi's letter concluding its review of hillary clinton's emails with a familiar refrain: the system's rigged.
now the republican nominee feels he has more proof that he's been right all along.
the fbi sent another letter to members of congress on sunday afternoon informing them that further review of clinton emails found on anthony weiner's laptop didn't change their conclusion in july to clear her of criminal wrongdoing.
trump, however, took issue with the process — after praising the fbi and director james comey for having taken up the review last week.
the praise was a reversal from past comments painting comey and the fbi as politically motivated in their recommendations over the summer and casting them as members of a rigged system.
more from nbc news:
fbi completes review of newly revealed hillary clinton emails, finds no evidence of criminality
final nbc/wsj poll: clinton holds four-point lead over trump
new app helps clinton supporters trade votes to key states
"right now, she is being protected by a rigged system.
it's a totally rigged system," trump said sunday.
"i've been saying it for a long time.
you can't review 650,000 new emails in eight days.
you can't do it, folks."
not all of those emails were clinton's, but trump often talks about them as though they were — a line used sunday by his campaign manager, kellyanne conway.
stakes are high as us election looms
peter trubowitz, professor of international relations and director of the united states center at lse, explains why he doesn’t believe the fbi’s latest decision will impact the polls greatly.
"do you think that they went through hundreds of thousands of emails in a week?
because that may strike a lot of americans as unusual," conway said on msnbc.
"i don't know if i'd have the capacity to do that."
while the decision effectively closes the matter for the clinton campaign, trump believes it's not over.
not a scientific survey.
results may not total 100% due to rounding.
"the investigations into her crimes will go on for a long, long time.
the rank-and-file special agents at the fbi won't let her get away with her terrible crimes," trump said.
he added later: "hillary clinton is guilty.
she knows it.
the fbi knows it.
the people know it."
his anti-clinton crowd that chanted, "lock her up!"
"and now it's up to the american people to deliver justice at the ballot box on november 8th," trump said.

nine days after throwing the presidential race into turmoil, fbi director james comey once more cleared hillary clinton of criminal wrongdoing sunday for using a private email server as secretary of state.
the verdict, less than 48 hours before election day, left democrats still fuming over what party leaders saw as improper political meddling, which caused polls to tighten across the country.
republicans brushed off comey’s findings and continued to accuse clinton of poor judgment and negligence in handling classified information.
comey said agents had worked “around the clock to process and review” emails found on a computer owned by former new york rep. anthony weiner.
the estranged husband of one of clinton’s closest aides, huma abedin, weiner is under investigation for exchanging sexually explicit texts with an underage girl.
“during that process, we have reviewed all of the communications that were to or from hillary clinton while she was secretary of state," comey wrote.
"based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in july with respect to secretary clinton."
at that time, the fbi director chided clinton for being “extremely careless” in setting up a private email server in the basement of her new york home, which allowed her to communicate outside official channels and the security protocol for government emails.
but he said there was no basis for bringing criminal charges.
of the hundreds of thousands of emails on weiner's computer, it turned out that only a few thousand were related to abedin and relevant to the clinton email probe, a federal law enforcement official said.
nearly all of those were duplicates of emails the fbi already had read, which the investigators were able to determine fairly quickly by using computer programs that rapidly compare texts.
none of the remaining emails rose to a level that would cause agents to reconsider whether clinton or her aides had knowingly mishandled classified information, the official said.
clinton, who spent sunday hopscotching from pennsylvania to ohio to new hampshire, did not comment publicly on comey’s latest announcement.
she stuck to a recitation of policy proposals such as more affordable college and criminal justice reforms.
but campaign officials expressed their satisfaction with the fbi’s findings.
“we are glad this matter is resolved,” spokeswoman jennifer palmieri told reporters en route to a campaign stop in cleveland, where the democratic nominee appeared at a get-out-the-vote rally with basketball star lebron james.
donald trump had just arrived in minnesota, bidding to snatch a democratic stronghold from clinton, when news of comey’s letter surfaced.
the gop nominee had lately taken to praising the fbi after questioning the integrity of the agency’s initial email probe.
he did not specifically mention sunday’s developments before the boisterous crowd at the minneapolis airport.
instead, trump renewed his charges of cronyism in the nation’s capital.
“she’s protected by a rigged system,” he said.
“she shouldn’t even be allowed to run for president.
she is the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency of the united states.”
but later, at a stop in the detroit suburbs, trump was more sharply critical of the fbi.
“you can’t review 650,000 new emails in eight days,” trump told a rowdy crowd of thousands at an outdoor amphitheater in sterling heights.
“you can’t do it, folks.
hillary clinton is guilty.
she knows it.
the fbi knows it.
the people know it,” he said.
“and now, it’s up to the american people to deliver justice at the ballot box on nov. 8.”
fellow republicans chimed in, saying the fbi’s decision against prosecuting clinton was hardly an exoneration.
“secretary clinton put our nation’s secrets at risk and in doing so compromised our national security,” house speaker paul d. ryan asserted.
“she simply believes she’s above the law and always plays by her own rules.”
legalities aside, comey’s announcement  — which caught many by surprise — undercut the central political argument that trump had been making against clinton in the closing days of the presidential race.
he repeatedly warned that, if elected, clinton would be crippled by a federal indictment and a tangle of congressional investigations into her email server.
whatever their relief sunday, democrats were still outraged the emails had again become a central issue — especially so close to the election.
many saw comey’s oct. 28 letter as a violation of justice department rules designed to prevent investigative actions from influencing voters.
even if clinton wins the white house, democrats fear the renewed controversy surrounding her emails — which dominated news headlines for more than a week — damaged their prospects in several close senate races that could determine control of the chamber.
“the october surprise that came only 11 days before election day has unfairly hurt the campaign of one candidate and changed the tenor of this election,” said california democratic sen. dianne feinstein, who suggested comey’s letter sunday made his actions “even more troubling.”
“there’s no doubt that it created a false impression about the nature of the agency’s inquiry,” she said.
“i believe the justice department needs to take a look at its procedures to prevent similar actions that could influence future elections.”
comey was appointed by president obama in 2013 to a 10-year term as head of the fbi.
he prides himself on his independence and tangled with the white house in his previous job as a senior justice department official in the george w. bush administration.
the fact that comey is a republican, however, coupled with a seeming deluge of leaks damaging to clinton from current or former fbi agents, elevated the anger among democrats.
former government officials and outside legal experts with knowledge of the case had said in recent days that the chances were slim that any of the newly found emails would change the fbi’s previous conclusions.
during the nearly yearlong investigation of clinton’s email practices, fbi agents had interviewed dozens of witnesses, conducted forensic tests and examined tens of thousands of messages.
even before comey’s letter, clinton had reason to look ahead with optimism.
a final round of polling released sunday affirmed the state of play heading into the campaign’s final 48 hours: a solid, if not overwhelming, lead for the democratic nominee and a struggle for trump to amass the 270 electoral votes needed to capture the white house.
early voting figures in florida, a state trump must carry, showed an outpouring of latinos and african americans, two of the groups strongest in their support for clinton.
in ohio, another must-win state for trump, the two candidates are effective
ly tied.
he trails in both pennsylvania and michigan, democratic-leaning states he has aggressively targeted.
still, as trump traveled sunday through several battleground states — iowa, minnesota, michigan, pennsylvania, virginia — his  camp insisted a history-making upset was in the offing.
“we’ve been expanding our map, and we are now competing in states where people wrote us off months ago,” kellyanne conway, trump’s campaign manager, said in a conference call with reporters.
but there was little independent evidence to support that assertion.
minnesota, for instance, hasn’t voted republican in a presidential election since 1972 — the longest such streak in the country — and trump has not led a single poll conducted there over the last 15 months.

• arsenal manager also bemoans ‘soft’ penalty which gave spurs their equaliser• wenger admitted his team ‘looked a bit flat’ in north london derby
dominic fifield at the emirates stadium
sunday 6 november 2016 16.27 gmt

arsène wenger was left cursing his side’s draw in the north london derby as two points dropped and said he was surprised the tottenham hotspur midfielder victor wanyama had escaped sanction for a series of fouls, pinpointing an elbow on theo walcott that went unpunished.
wanyama twice clashed with the england international on arsenal’s right touchline towards the end of the first half and walcott, who had been left holding the back of his head after the first incident, reacted angrily the second time and had to be separated from a furious jan vertonghen.
the kenya midfielder was not booked by mark clattenburg.
“he was very lucky to stay on the pitch, of course,” said wenger.
“there were a few fouls, the elbow on walcott for example.
but the referee makes the decisions and we have to cope with that.
nobody stopped us scoring a second goal [but ourselves].”
the arsenal manager, who was equally unimpressed with the award of tottenham’s penalty from which harry kane equalised, refused to use the midweek trip to bulgaria in the champions league as an excuse for a second-half performance which lacked the usual spark and intensity.
spurs duly capitalised to pull themselves level and maintain their unbeaten start to their top-flight campaign.
“it is two points lost,” said the frenchman.
“it was a game of high intensity and in the first half we’d always looked like we could score every time we crossed the halfway line.
but in the second half we were a bit more flat, physically, and less sharp.
technically the level dropped in the second half.
“we couldn’t find creativity around the box and all the vision we are used to.
our level dropped.
we were a bit too stretched as well and not compact enough and, when you are too stretched, you run more.
was there a mental blow when they equalised?
i don’t know.
i cannot question the spirit but we looked a bit flat.
we gave absolutely everything but we lacked what we are strong at – the fluency of movement, vision around the box – and we usually play better from the back.
there was a lot missing and plenty of aspects i did not like.
the desire was there, but we were too nervous.”
the result means arsenal, who are unbeaten since the opening weekend of the campaign, drop to fourth place in the table over the international break, though they remain only two points from liverpool at the summit.
the merseysiders, like chelsea in second place, are playing this season without the considerable midweek distraction of european competition.
asked whether that serves as an advantage for their rivals’ title challenge, wenger said: “it’s a bit easier to prepare for games because you don’t have the intensity of the champions league games but, if you asked them, they’d like to be playing in europe.
“we cannot complain about that.
there’s a little physical advantage for sure, especially after european weeks, but we have to deal with that.
it’s not an excuse for today.
and, even if liverpool and chelsea are in front, it’s a small difference after 11 games.
spurs go home happy today and we are not happy because we wanted to win the game.
but overall it is not mathematically a disaster.”
the arsenal manager was unimpressed at the award of spurs’ penalty just after the interval when laurent koscielny swung his leg and made contact with mousa dembélé’s right foot inside the box.
“from the outside it looked a very soft penalty and i was surprised it was given,” said wenger, whose side next confront manchester united at old trafford on the saturday after the international window.
“it looked harsh.
it didn’t look a deliberate foul or that he was [in a] dangerous position to score.
“even speaking to some referees, some say they would give it and others would not.
as arsenal’s manager, i obviously wouldn’t have given it.
so we were a bit unlucky on that but spurs defended well, particularly in the last 10 or 15 minutes when we put some crosses in.
we couldn’t make enough of our corners and missed some opportunities.
so, while the desire was there, maybe the result was fair.”

des moines, iowa —  if hillary clinton makes it to the white house, a whole lot of eyes will be on her list of do's and don'ts.
throughout the presidential campaign against donald trump, clinton has made some very specific pledges about what she would and wouldn't do.
those could come back at clinton if she's elected, because she could be governing in a politically polarized environment.
republicans and liberal democrats would keep watch to see whether she keeps her word.
she's made promises on a variety of issues, including taxes, a pacific trade deal, the u.s. military role in the mideast and college costs.

the prime minister says she is confident of overturning court ruling that parliamentary approval is required to leave eu

sunday 6 november 2016 11.06 gmt


last modified on sunday 6 november 2016 17.41 gmt
parliament must accept that britain’s vote to leave the european union was legitimate and let the government get on with delivering brexit, prime minister theresa may said on sunday.
may has said she is confident of overturning a british court ruling that the government needs parliamentary approval to start the process of leaving the eu.
the government, which has given little away about its plans for britain’s future relationship with the eu, has said that having to set out a detailed negotiating strategy to parliament would put it at a disadvantage in talks with the bloc.
“while others seek to tie our negotiating hands, the government will get on with the job of delivering the decision of the british people,” may said in a statement ahead of her first trade trip to india on sunday.
“it was mps who overwhelmingly decided to put the decision in their hands.
the result was clear.
it was legitimate.
mps and peers who regret the referendum result need to accept what the people decided.”
may will use her first bilateral trade trip since taking office to try to boost ties with india before britain leaves the eu and to pave the way for a free trade deal as soon as possible once brexit is completed.
parliament could in theory block brexit as most members supported staying in the eu in june’s referendum, although it is unlikely to do so.
the ruling could allow lawmakers to temper the government’s approach, however, making a “hard brexit” – where tight controls on immigration are prioritised over remaining in the european single market – less likely.
a government appeal against the high court ruling is expected to be considered by britain’s supreme court early next month.
may has said she still plans to launch talks on the terms of brexit by the end of march.
“we need to turn our minds to how we get the best outcome for our country,” she said.
“that means sticking to our plan and timetable, getting on with the work of developing our negotiating strategy and not putting all our cards on the table – that is not in our national interest and it won’t help us get the best deal for britain.”

donald trump and hillary clinton are swinging through key battleground states in a last ditch attempt to sway voters two days before polling.
northern states are the focus, with both candidates due to appear in michigan and pennsylvania.
mr trump believes a recent rise in polls can help him win states formally seen as democratic strongholds.
mrs clinton will continue to use a-list supporters, buoyed by two polls on sunday giving her a 4-5 point lead.
latest on sunday's campaigning
sunday's campaign stops take mrs clinton to ohio, michigan, pennsylvania and new hampshire, while mr trump travels to iowa, minnesota, michigan, pennsylvania and virginia.
a new nbc/wall st journal opinion poll on sunday suggested a four-point lead for mrs clinton.
the latest washington post/abc tracking poll puts her lead at five points.
mrs clinton's latest a-list backer - in the wake of beyonce, jay z and katy perry - will be basketball star lebron james.
mrs clinton will appear with him in cleveland, home town of his nba champion cavaliers.
she also plans to appear in manchester, ohio, with khizr khan, the father of a fallen us muslim soldier, who delivered an emotional attack on mr trump at the democratic national convention.
her first stop was in the mainly african american congregation of mount airy church of god in christ in philadelphia.
african american turnout could be key in the election.
black clergy have begun a "souls to the poll" campaign to urge people to get out and vote.
more than 40 million early voters have already cast their ballots.
reports suggest many more latino voters are turning out early in battleground states including florida, arizona and nevada compared to past elections.
mr trump is heading into another marathon day of campaigning, hoping to further tighten the gap in states he now believes he can win.
in his first stop in iowa, he said that if mrs clinton were elected there would be an "unprecedented constitutional crisis" over the allegations she faces over her handling of sensitive material during her time as secretary of state.
he cited new claims in the new york post that mrs clinton had directed her maid to print out sensitive and classified emails for her to read at home.
mrs clinton has seen her lead slip following last week's fbi announcement that it was looking into emails that may be connected to her use of a private email server while secretary of state.
campaign manager kellyanne conway said mr trump would keep up his breakneck speed right into election day on tuesday, when he would visit pennsylvania, michigan, ohio, north carolina and new hampshire.
republican vice-presidential candidate mike pence said: "our secret weapon is the american people who are saying 'enough is enough'."
hillary clinton's chief strategist, john podesta, said on sunday that she would focus on nevada and michigan, adding that if she won those two in particular, "hillary clinton is going to be the next president of the united states."
he said: "we're feeling very solid going into this last weekend."
mr podesta also accused mr trump of being an advocate of russian foreign policy and rejecting the bipartisan us approach.
on saturday evening, mr trump was briefly rushed off stage by secret service agents at a rally in reno, nevada, in a false alarm.
a man holding a sign saying republicans against trump was tackled by security agents.
the secret service later confirmed that someone in front of the stage had shouted "gun", but that "upon a thorough search of the subject and the surrounding area, no weapon was found".
austyn crites, the man at the centre of the disturbance, said he was attacked when he brought out his sign.
"i keep repeating - i'm down, someone is trying to choke me - and i'm saying to these people; 'there is no gun, i just have a sign'," mr crites explained after the incident.

turkey's pro-kurdish opposition party, the hdp, has vowed to halt all activity in the country's parliament after its joint leaders were arrested.
selahattin demirtas and figen yuksekdag are accused of spreading propaganda for militants fighting the turkish state.
they and 10 other activists deny links to the pkk kurdish rebel group.
president recep tayyip erdogan has hit back at international critics after the arrests, accusing europe of "abetting terrorism".
profile: the kurdistan workers' party (pkk)
turkey's hdp party goes mainstream
who was behind attempted coup?
turkish prime minister binali yildirim said hdp members would be betraying the public if they failed to attend parliament.
the party said its mps would not resign, but nor would they take part in sittings.
hours after the hdp members were arrested, a huge car bomb killed eight people and wounded more than 100 in the south-eastern city of diyarbakir.
turkish authorities blamed the outlawed pkk (kurdistan workers' party), but the so-called islamic state group later claimed the attack through its amaq news agency.
responding to global criticism over the arrests of the hdp leaders and activists, mr erdogan accused europe of aiding terrorism through its support for the pkk, and said he did not care if europe called him a dictator.
"europe, as a whole, is abetting terrorism," he said in a televised speech.
"even though they declared the pkk a terrorist organisation, this is clear... we see how the pkk can act so freely and comfortably in europe."
"i don't care if they call me dictator or whatever else, it goes in one ear, out the other.
what matters is what my people call me," he said.
mr erdogan said that parliamentarians behaving as terrorists would be treated as such.
militants have been fighting for years to achieve independence for the kurds, who are turkey's biggest ethnic minority.
but hopes of an end to turkey's decades-long kurdish problem have evaporated since a ceasefire with the pkk broke down in 2015, leading to a wave of tit-for-tat attacks.
turkey remains under a state of emergency that was imposed after a failed military coup in july.

nigel farage, the interim leader of the u.k.
independence party, has warned of civil unrest in britain if citizens feel they have been "cheated" over the result of the brexit referendum.
"believe you me, if the people in this country think they're going to be cheated, they're going to be betrayed, then we will see political anger the likes of which none of us in our lifetimes have ever witnessed in this country," he told the bbc on sunday morning.
the brexit campaigner agreed there would be a real danger of disturbance in the streets.
he called on brexit backers to "get even" via peaceful protests, adding that lawmakers that want to "overturn this process" should not be supported.

uk high court rules brexit requires parliament vote
cnbc's wilfred frost reports the latest news on article 50.
his comments come after a court ruled thursday that the entire u.k. parliament must vote on whether the country can start the process of leaving the european union.
this has dealt a blow to prime minister theresa may, who had argued that the government on its own could trigger "article 50" and start the divorce with the european union.
may's stance had led to concerns that lawmakers at the heart of the u.k. government would opt and force through a so-called "hard brexit" without the consent of parliament.
a "hard brexit" scenario would likely mean a loss of access to the eu's single market but more control over its immigration policy.
farage has argued against staying a member of this single market and is now concerned that the country is heading for a "half brexit".

as andy murray is set to be officially crowned the world's leading male tennis player he has secured himself another piece of personal and british sporting history.
not only is it another achievement to rank alongside his three grand slam wins and two olympic gold medals, but it's also the first time a british man has topped the atp world rankings since they were launched 43 years ago.
murray needed to reach the final of the paris masters to replace novak djokovic - and did so when milos raonic pulled out before their semi-final.
he can now rank himself alongside legends from the 1970s, such as nastase, borg, mcenroe and connors, through to current stars federer, nadal and djokovic.
his status will be official when the atp releases its latest rankings on monday.
according to other current stats from the atp, the 29-year-old made more than $10m (£8m) in prize money this year.
but according to figures from business publication forbes, the scot made some $15m from endorsements alone last year, a figure which eclipses his playing earnings.
and it is his off-court earnings where the real financial potential now lies.
"being world number one will significantly enhance murray's brand value," says branding expert anastasia kourovskaia, who has worked with a number of big names in the leisure and sporting industry.
"he has always been the challenger, and associated with having tenacity, motivation, and having goals, and not giving up.
also of being the rebel - the outsider.
"all the above attributes have now received validation, and shown to have paid off, but he will be in the position of not being the challenger any more."
she adds: "we will now have an interesting situation to see which direction his brand will go in.
and it will be interesting to see if it has any change on his behaviour or the way he acts on court."
indeed, one tennis champion who changed his on-court appearance after he ascended to the number one spot was spanish star rafael nadal.
over the course of 2008 and 2009 his image moved from piratical to practical, as he shed the sleeveless shirts and long pants for more regulation polo shirt (and also round necked t-shirts) and shorts.
ms kourovskaia says that murray could continue to present himself as the challenger brand, but that might seem "less authentic" now that he is in the top spot.
she says that should he want to make a change into a more establishment brand, he was well placed, with his own am marketing logo already in place, as well as a strong family-man image after his marriage to kim sears and the birth of his first child.
murray currently has a small number of companies that he has deals with.
in january 2015 he left adidas for a four-year deal with us kit-maker under armour, believed to be worth around £15m.
he also has agreements with financial services firm standard life and tennis racquet maker head.
and he added luxury car marque jaguar to his roster at the beginning of this year, to complete a quartet of partnerships.
"if, as i suspect, he accepts a more establishment role, that will indeed open up more potential sponsorship opportunities," says ms kourovskaia.
"bu it may be that he and his management are happy with the small number of endorsements that he has."
she also says that being number one could make him more of an international brand than a british one.
murray's agent is matt gentry, who has worked with him since 2009 when he was part of simon fuller's xix entertainment.
gentry is now managing director of murray's own management company, 77.
ms kourovskaia said it was certain that murray will talk over his future strategy with his management team, but that any sponsorship collaborations would have to be tight-knit for both the player and the firms involved.
that is, any new company he signs with should not have a vast roster of other famous personalities that it is backing, and there also would have to be an understanding that murray is not going to sign a huge glut of new deals either.
"that way the murray image is not diluted," says ms kourovskaia.
"the fact that he does not already have many sponsors is an attraction to any other potential partners, as it means they can still create powerful associations with him."
she says that one immediate beneficiary of murray's ascent will be under armour.
"it was also a challenger brand, and they are well positioned with him," she says.
"they will feel validated by signing him.
"but if he decides to go down an 'establishment' route, then they will also be able to capitalise on the fact that they have come with him from outsider to number one."
that under armour deal will see murray through into his early 30s, and ms kourovskaia says he may already be planning ahead for a life post-tennis.
"he seems to me to be someone who plans well into the future, and although i am sure he has no intention of stopping playing any time soon,  he and his team will already be considering that day," she says.
"he does genuinely love playing and love tennis, and he can be a great ambassador for the sport, continuing through his time now as number one, for the rest of his playing career, and then into retirement."
that, she says, would then be the time - should he desire - to build on that ambassadorial presence and launch his own am-branded products, such as tennis academies.
murray will be hoping for a lengthy reign.
after all, the vast potential branding opportunities could count for nothing if he only lasts a short time at the top, like carlos moya, who reigned for two weeks, or pat rafter, who lasted just one.

marrakech, morocco —  u.n. climate talks open monday against the backdrop of a u.s. election that could have a major impact on america's role in the global agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
given hillary clinton and donald trump's diverging views on climate change and the landmark emissions pact adopted in paris last year, some countries' delegates have been unusually blunt about their preferred outcome.
brazilian environment minister sarney filho told reporters in a conference call thursday he believes american society supports climate action regardless of who becomes the next president.
"however, on a personal note, i hope trump doesn't win," he added.
clinton backs the climate policies of president barack obama's government, including continued engagement in the paris agreement.
trump, meanwhile, has expressed doubts about global warming on social media and said in a speech this year that he would "cancel" the climate deal if elected.
those comments have raised concerns in other countries about whether the u.s. would ignore its commitments under the agreement — or withdraw from it completely — if trump were elected.
advertisement
asked about trump's remarks on the paris deal, china's top climate negotiator xie zhenhua said "a wise leader" should conform to global development trends.
"if you go against the tide, people will not agree and the economy and the social development of these countries will also be affected," xie said earlier this month.
the obama administration played a key role in making the paris deal come together, particularly by forming a partnership with china that saw the world's top two polluters take the lead in global efforts to slash emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
under the paris deal, the obama administration pledged to reduce u.s. greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.
but u.s. republicans are opposed to the deal, saying it will harm the u.s. economy.
trump has called for stripping regulations to allow unfettered production of fossil fuels — a key source of carbon emissions — and rescinding the clean power plan, an obama administration strategy to fight climate change.
in marrakech, delegates will be working on the details of implementing the paris deal, such as drafting rules for how to measure and report emissions as well as the financial contributions meant to help poor countries deal with climate change.
the u.s. under the bush administration decided not to join the previous climate deal, the 1997 kyoto protocol, which only regulated the emissions of developed nations.
that was a major blow to the agreement, and after other countries dropped out kyoto ended up covering only a small portion of global emissions.
climate policy officials in the obama administration said they believe this time other countries would go ahead even if the u.s. were to back out, because they see it as in their national interests to shift to cleaner energy.
advertisement
"it's a question of how quickly we move forward, and frankly, who will lead and who will benefit most from this transition to a lower carbon economy," said john morton, the white house's senior director for energy and climate.
although it is possible to withdraw from the paris deal, it would take four years — an entire presidential term — to complete the process.
that's partly why countries were in such a hurry to ratify it before the u.s. presidential election on nov. 8.
u.s. climate envoy jonathan pershing said he didn't think a u.s. withdrawal from the climate pact was likely because there are "going to be huge domestic advantages to staying in this agreement and to do the work that we've agreed to do."
observers of the climate talks said delegates in marrakech are likely to keep a close eye on the u.s. election, which occurs on the second day of the conference.
liz gallagher of the london-based environmental think tank e3g said she believes the outcome will have bigger significance for the united states' role in the international negotiations than for its domestic transition toward cleaner energy.
"on the domestic side, it's moving low-carbon for sure," she said.
"that worries me less than how a new u.s. president would use climate diplomacy the way obama has done."
there is no question the u.s. election presents "real political risks to the global climate efforts," said mohamed adow, a climate policy expert at christian aid.
"but the good news is that the world has prepared for it and hedged against the worst likely outcome by ratifying the paris agreement at an unprecedented speed."

donald j. trump is in striking distance of winning the election with two days to go, and there’s really just one reason for that: he’s leading white voters without a college degree by a huge margin.
in recent national surveys, mr. trump leads hillary clinton by 59 percent to 30 percent among that group.
it’s larger than the 57-35 lead that mitt romney had with those voters in the final polls in 2012.
on their own, mr. trump’s gains among this group have been enough to cancel out four years of favorable demographic shifts for democrats among hispanic and well-educated white voters.
hillary clinton is faring worse than president obama among white working-class voters.
he has even won supporters among some of the same white voters who backed barack obama in 2008.
it suggests that mr. trump and mr. obama might have a little more in common than you might think — at least from a political standpoint.
if mr. trump wins the presidency, that will ultimately be why.
it has been a consistent pattern all year.
whenever mr. trump fights his way into a tight race with mrs. clinton, it’s because he manages to run up the score with blue-collar white voters.
advertisement
in the past week, analysis of the early vote has already made it clear that turnout will be more than high enough for a democrat to win a presidential election.
latino turnout will be high.
black turnout may not reach 2012 levels, but it will not be so low that one could reasonably blame black turnout for a clinton loss.
but mr. trump’s strength among the white working class gives him a real chance at victory, a possibility that many discounted as recently as the summer.
he could win enough electoral college votes without winning the popular vote, through narrow victories in midwestern and northeastern battlegrounds like wisconsin and new hampshire, where democrats depend on support among white working-class voters.
mr. trump’s strength with that group could even be enough for him to win florida, where mrs. clinton’s abundant support among hispanic voters would otherwise all but doom a republican.
there are far more college-educated whites or hispanic romney voters whom trump has to lose in the south than there are white working-class voters for him to gain.
the opposite is true farther north.
the conventional wisdom after 2012 held that mr. obama was a historically weak candidate among white working-class voters, and that there wasn’t much room for the republicans to make additional gains.
to the extent that there was an argument for how republicans could make big gains among the group, it was that they could rally the support of missing white voters — a group that in reality appears more democratic than the white voters who do turn out in elections.
but exit polls tend to undercount the number of less educated voters, and the national exit polls obscured mr. obama’s strength among white voters in the north.
they showed him faring worse among white voters than any democrat since walter mondale, but that was exclusively because of his weakness in the south.
in many northern states — like iowa and ohio — mr. obama did better among white voters than past democrats.
there was a lot of room for mrs. clinton to fall.
she’s proving it.
for many, it was very hard to imagine that mrs. clinton — a white democrat who excelled among white working-class voters in the 2008 democratic primary — could lose voters who supported mr. obama in the 2012 election, or who approve of his performance today.
it’s even stranger if one believes that racism is at the core of mr. trump’s appeal: if mr. trump’s supporters are animated by racism, then why did so many of them vote for mr. obama?
racism might well animate mr. trump’s base.
but his appeal among some white obama supporters suggests that mr. trump and mr. obama might have something in common.

mr. trump has changed the story lines of the 2012 and 2008 elections — and tapped into many of the same issues and frames that helped mr. obama.
in 2008, mr. obama depicted himself as an agent of hope and change: he ran against washington, the establishment and special interests.
in 2012, the obama campaign attacked its republican opponent, mitt romney, as a plutocrat who would outsource jobs and help the wealthy, not the middle class.
those are the kinds of reasons that white working-class democrats in places like scranton, pa., and youngstown, ohio, remained with the democrats.
advertisement
in this election, mr. trump flipped that frame.
he ran against the establishment — and against a candidate who embodies it far more than john mccain or mr. romney.
he depicted mrs. clinton as someone who supports corporate — even global — interests over the middle class on issues like trade and immigration.
the various allegations against mrs. clinton neatly complement the notion that she’s not trying to help ordinary americans.
mrs. clinton, meanwhile, has spent more time questioning mr. trump’s fitness for the presidency than emphasizing the traditional democratic campaign message about the economy.
mr. trump is expected to fall short of the presidency, in part because of his problems capitalizing on mrs. clinton’s deep weakness among white working-class voters.
there are probably many young white men without a degree, for instance, who liked mr. obama and don’t like either mr. trump or mrs. clinton.
regardless of the outcome, these voters will loom over american politics.
huge parts of the republican party’s establishment would undoubtedly prefer a candidate who’s friendlier to their views on immigration and trade.
if mrs. clinton wins with strength among the well educated and hispanic voters, much of the republican establishment will conclude that those groups are in their electoral interest as well.
but the voters receptive to mr. trump’s views on these issues would have pulled republicans awfully close to victory, even with a deeply flawed candidate.
they’re also among the voters likeliest to be skeptical of mrs. clinton in four years.
it would be difficult for the party not to cater to them.
democrats would have the opposite challenge.
four years after demographic shifts were credited for mr. obama’s victory, the party would undoubtedly realize the extent to which they remain dependent on the support of voters whom they might have assumed they no longer needed.
at the same time, their winning coalition would be better educated and more diverse than ever before.
without a republican like mr. trump as a foil, it could be hard to devise an agenda and a message that would hold mrs. clinton’s coalition together.

isner performed very well there – was it his best performance against murray?
– but still fell short against the world’s best player.
murray was positive throughout and kept his head even when the american’s serves were flying at him.
the world no1 moves on to next week’s atp world tour finals in london where he will aim to finish off his remarkable season in style and be crowned the end of year best player.
thanks for reading.

the american hits his first double fault for 0-30 but battles back to 30-30 – the levelling point came from another ace – before allowing murray one match point.
isner’s first serve is out (he challenges but the call stands) and murray seals the title by forcing isner to volley into the net.
that’s his eighth title of the year and 19th win in a row.

isner looks good early in this game but murray claws him back and has a break point after an inexplicably poor volley from the american.
this is murray’s first break point since the sixth game of the first set and he cannot take it.
isner comes to the net to send his returned serve to murray’s left and pushes on from deuce to hold.
an email from thomas harrington – although he has the grand tour final to come on monday week!
andy looks very tired, and so he should be with all the tennis he has played this year, it’s definitely catching up with him, much as isner is playing well, andy is mentally and physically struggling.
i don’t think we will see the best of andy again until the australian open end of january, when he will have had the benefit (at last) of a good rest, no one deserves it more!!
hopefully still win this final though!

3.26pm gmt
15:26
murray 4-5 isner* (6-3): isner has not dropped his head after that previous game and knuckles down to hold his serve.
this, you sense, is headed for a tiebreak.
3.22pm gmt
15:22
murray* 4-4 isner (6-3): there have not been too many long rallies (five points with nine or more shots to be precise) but the first point here is great – isner getting murray on the run before finishing it off with a drop shot.
then murray makes a rare unforced error, finding the net with a forehand for 0-30 before an isner winner earns him three break points.
he should really take the first but overhits a backhand after murray came to the net.
the second is also saved with an overhead shot after coming to the net again.
murray then forces an error for deuce.
isner claims another break but murray clambers back to deuce again.
isner shows signs of fatigue and, having had several chances to break, he ends up letting the game sleep.
3.12pm gmt
15:12
murray 3-4 isner* (6-3): at 30-15 a murray return is called out (he challenges but the call stands) but apart from that the player on serve dominates again.
3.10pm gmt
15:10
murray* 3-3 isner (6-3): with murray serving this well, isner is unable to get a look.
this latest game is to love and the points are not particularly testing.
3.06pm gmt
15:06
murray 2-3 isner* (6-3): isner begins with a serve of 213km/h (!)
and then follows up with some good play at the net – that will help after his earlier problems there.
yet murray responds with a remarkable cross-court forehand to make it 30-15, before the american responds himself.
he has been good on serve apart from that first set break but he needs to now do something against it.

3.03pm gmt
15:03
murray* 2-2 isner (6-3): murray, who has hardly broken a sweat, holds again without much in the way of return fire.
2.57pm gmt
14:57
murray 1-2 isner* (6-3): isner misses another shocker when coming to the net at 30-0, volleying into the net, but he still polishes off another service game with a powerful serve that has plenty of topspin.
2.55pm gmt
14:55
murray* 1-1 isner (6-3): splendid serving from murray, who holds to love.
he looks comfortable here, especially on his own serve.
2.52pm gmt
14:52
murray 0-1 isner* (6-3): isner wins the first two points but then slows down and allows murray back in to the opening game of this second set.
no matter, the big server displays his power to close it out.
an email from simon mcmahon on murray becoming no1:
afternoon alan.
i ran out of superlatives for andy murray years ago.
the no.
1 ranking is just the cherry on top of a very big, well decorated cake, and just reward for the years of dedication and hard work that he has put into his game.
he’s already a truly great champion, and were he never to win another match he would remain one of scotland, britain and the world’s best ever sportsmen.
if, however, as seems entirely possible, he was to, say, double his grand slam tally over the next three years, adding the australian and french titles, maybe another wimbledon or us open, he would join the true legends of the game.
let’s go andy!

murray is temporarily frustrated when isner battles to 30-30.
but he then aces and isner challenges, thinking it’s wide.
the challenge is unsuccessful and murray needs just the one set point because isner is unable to return a serve towards the american’s backhand.
updated
at 3.00pm gmt
2.43pm gmt
14:43
murray 5-3 isner*: murray will have to serve for the set though after isner holds to love, finishing up with a magnificent ace.
2.41pm gmt
14:41
murray* 5-2 isner: murray confirms the break by holding but it is far from easy because isner earns two break points with a sublime forehand return that is too powerful for murray’s backhand.
murray comes to the net to save the first and isner wastes the second by finding the net.
murray gets to advantage but is clawed back by a tasty winner from isner.
back on deuce, the briton digs in and closes in on the opening set.
2.34pm gmt
14:34
murray 4-2 isner*: isner cracks!
but it’s an excellent game from murray, who battles back from 30-15 to break thanks to a couple of excellent returns on serve and a bit of exceptional net play that leaves the us no1 flummoxed.
isner missed another volley at 30-15 and that gave murray the initiative to step up a level and earn an advantage in this opening set.
updated
at 2.35pm gmt
2.28pm gmt
14:28
murray* 3-2 isner: isner should have a first break point but he finds the net with murray on the run at 30-30.
on deuce, murray gets to advantage with a driven forehand that isner is unable to return.
the scot then holds.
who will be the first to crack?
2.23pm gmt
14:23
murray 2-2 isner*: isner will not be rolled over as easily as in vienna last week.
he, too, comes to the net and produces a lovely drop shot that evades murray for 30-0 and, although murray pulls a point back,the big man holds without any bother.
2.20pm gmt
14:20
murray* 2-1 isner: murray comes to the net for the first time at 30-0 and then closes the game out to love by forcing an error out of his opponent.
that’s eight points in a row on serve for the scot.
now, how can he respond against isner’s serve?

murray 1-1 isner*: the american’s first service game is pretty standard – piling down a couple of aces.

2.14pm gmt
14:14
murray* 1-0 isner: a slightly odd start as world no1 begins with a double fault, but he then follows up with an ace and holds without much bother.
2.11pm gmt
14:11
murray will serve first.
2.09pm gmt
14:09
remember when us players were the standard bearers?
this will be isner’s fifth year as his country’s best player – but, big serve aside, he is not the most testing.
he is too tall to be move as freely as the best.
anyway, the players are out on court and are warming up.
we’re not too far away.

13:40
the story behind murray’s rise to the top
10.16am gmt
10:16
let’s all bow at the feet of andy murray, the new world no1.
what a year 2016 has been for the scot and he will look to add another title here before next week’s season closer, the grand tour finals at london’s o2.
enough has been written over the past 24 hours about murray and where he ranks in the pantheon (see link below), so let’s focus on today’s game for now.
murray has a 100% record against john isner and leads 18-3 on sets.
the american, who will finish as his country’s best player again, has been playing well but is still unlikely to cause murray too many problems on current form.
in vienna less than a fortnight ago murray won 6-1 6-3 en route to the title and he also advanced in straight sets at the french open earlier in the year.
this would be isner’s first masters 1000 title, murray has already won 13.
however this particular gong has evaded him, losing to novak djokovic, the now former no1, in last year’s showpiece.
play is set to begin a little after 3pm local time, or 2pm gmt.

actually, just one more bit of news and it’s significant: shaun marsh has broken his finger and will miss the hobart test.
joe burns and callum ferguson come into the squad for him and potentially adam voges, who tweaked his hamstring yesterday.
late drama!
shaun marsh has re-broken his finger.
will need surgery.

that’ll do.
after five long and mostly enthralling days, it has really all been said.
but in signing off, i want to thank you for your company throughout.
i’m sure i can speak on behalf of all your obo-ers in saying we’ve had a great time bringing this coverage to you.
we’ll be back in hobart on saturday morning.
until then.
7.47am gmt
07:47
what a performance.
this bloke is 21.
and the real shift in this game courtesy of him on day two when he rushed through usman khawaja’s defence from around the wicket.
from there, it was his game, seven wickets.
“i can confidently say there will be not a lot of bowling in the days to come,” he says at the presentation.
“but i’ll be ready for hobart... if i get chosen.” i reckon he you might be needed.
steve smith is now with mark nicholas.
“that partnership really took the game from us,” he says of elgar and duminy.
“we have had a few collapses of late... that have let us down when we have been in a position to drive the game.
what’s next?
“we try and let go of this performance.” too right.
to faf du plessis now, the triumphant captain.
“kagiso was phenomenal,” he begins.
“we had some harsh words after day one, we were very disappointed, and we wanted to come back with a solid performance the way we came back was quite ridiculous, then we backed it up on day three again.
from day one we have been unbelievable.”
7.35am gmt
07:35
that’s it!
lyon’s defence beaten, the drs assessing the ball to clip.
it’s enough.
rabada has 5-for-92, a wicket each to duminy, bavuma, philander and maharaj.
nevill left unbeaten on 60, australia a good couple of hours short of drawing the game.
i’ll keep an ear on the post game presentation and wrap this up.
back shortly.
7.32am gmt
07:32
review!
could the test be over?
stand by!
lyon given lbw off maharaj.
7.32am gmt
07:32
119th over: australia 361-9 (nevill 60, lyon 8) philander maiden to nevill.
he won’t give this up.
he just won’t.
7.27am gmt
07:27
118th over: australia 361-9 (nevill 60, lyon 8) nev into the 60s by the end of that bavuma set.
let’s have a terrace song?
“nevill nevill, safe in defence.
nevill nevill, future’s immense.
nevill nevill, replaced hadds.
top bat!
and his gloves are rad.”
7.25am gmt
07:25
review!
look, they pitched it up because why wouldn’t they?
bavuma’s inducker ran into lyon’s front pad, but it was assessed by ball-tracker as missing by a decent margin.
copped a bit of grief today, the ball tracker.
my take?
if you believe in the science you believe in the science.
especially now that india have taken off their tin foil hats on the topic.
tipping mitch marsh doesn’t share my confidence after this morning, mind.
7.23am gmt
07:23
117th over: australia 358-9 (nevill 59, lyon 6) the most eventful moment of this maharaj over (he’s back, replacing jpd from the prindiville end) is when a throw from the outfield whacks elgar on the back.
hilarity.
lyon is looking alright, you know.
now i’ve said that, of course, he’s no chance of making it to tea.
i’m a reliable indicator like that.
7.20am gmt
07:20
116th over: australia 355-9 (nevill 56, lyon 6) how cute that de kock went and stood back to bavuma in that over?
very.
very cute.
nevill takes a single first ball, which isn’t the orthodoxy when batting with no.
11.
but lyon, long-term nightwatchman, isn’t your garden variety no.
11.
i feel obliged to say that when we played at the same club he made 90 on 50 odd balls once upon a time.
and he’s also faced 89 balls in a test innings before, twitter tells me.
carn, nath.
keep them out there long as possible.

7.16am gmt
07:16
115th over: australia 354-9 (nevill 55, lyon 6) surprised to see duminy continuing, but at this stage they will want to keep the quicks away from the bowling crease.
he goes for three.
no worries for lyon there.
7.13am gmt
07:13
114th over: australia 351-9 (nevill 52, lyon 6) that, i neglected to mention below, was bavuma’s first test wicket as well.
he’s had some sort of game, starting with his critical half century on the first day when wickets fell around him.
and lyon nearly makes it two in two balls to end the match when getting a big edge, but it doesn’t go to hand.
he then takes a couple behind square leg.
can he bat for... oh, you know what?
i’m not doing that anymore.
not until lyon has been out there for half an hour at least.
bavuma a stocky all round version of gus logie is a game breaker
7.08am gmt
07:08
oh no!
south africa need just one wicket now, the 65 run stand brought to an end with a leading edge.
the delivery after copping a beam ball no less.
so the very moment the proteas look to be losing their way, they find the wicket that puts them a ball from a one-nil series lead.
tea will surely be extended as well.
and i’m mad up for a sausage roll, so this didn’t work out that well for anyone.
to be fair to the big quick, it was a great effort lasting 71 balls and a solid hour and a half.
can’t be expected to do much more than that.

7.05am gmt
07:05
113rd over: australia 340-8 (nevill 50, hazlewood 27) duminy again, and again no concerns for hazlewood who sees off the bulk of the over.
i reckon they might go back to the specialist twirler for the last over they will get from that end before the tea break.
when he had enough of defending, hazlewood cut him for a couple as well to keep the board ticking over.
as it has been for the last half hour with decent regularity.
updated
at 7.13am gmt
7.02am gmt
07:02
112th over: australia 340-8 (nevill 50, hazlewood 27) hazlewood dropped!
bavuma took his edge from a ball that landed just on the crack, and as the way when the keeper is up to the stumps amla was unsighted at first slip until late, necessitating a late dive.
he can’t snaffle it.
another edge next ball!
but this falls two feet in front of amla.
four byes earlier in the over as well, so a fair bit going on behind the wicket when the “all rounder” (let’s go with that) is on.
ric finlay informs radio listeners that it is inside 200 runs to win now as well.
droll, ric.
droll.
amla's test:1 run2 dropped catches
6.59am gmt
06:59
111th over: australia 336-8 (nevill 50, hazlewood 27) that’ll be nevill to a half century!
what a lovely little hand this has been, both for the strokeplay - not least the pick up through midwicket to reach the milestone - but the patience to tough it out on the final day like this.
the previous ball went to the boundary too, beyond third man and brought up the fifty stand between these two as well.
don’t think many saw this coming an hour and a half ago.
13 minutes from taking this game to a final session.
how about that?
fifty!
super knock here from @pmnevill off 138 balls!
his third test half century #ausvsa https://t.co/guzf2syxwf
6.56am gmt
06:56
110th over: australia 326-8 (nevill 40, hazlewood 27) bavuma into the attack again with his little 110kph specials.
oh how we love this bloke.
much like his first ball in test cricket, he gets one to shoot through to begin.
but nevill is in, and not going to miss when it is coming down at that pace.
he picks up a couple to midwicket when the misdirected delivery inevitably arrives later in the over.
on the radio dirk nannes compares him to ricky ponting with the ball.
gives me a wonderful chance to do a bit of cross promo, doesn’t it?
i have a piece in the cricketer mag this month dealing with golden arms, ponting featuring.
and here are all his wickets for australia.
fun fact: jimmy adams was world number one bat which he nabbed him in this collation.
oh, and vaughan in the ‘05 ashes.
and kallis in an odi.
and lara first ball in an odi.
you’re welcome.
6.49am gmt
06:49
camera falling out of sky.
well, not quite.
but skycam has literally dropped into the sightscreen.
not quite sure how it has happened, but there is a wire caught behind the frame.
and they won’t be able to continue as it s because it’ll be be behind the bowlers’ arm.
getting a replay now, the able has been fixed and away it goes.
that was... loose.
6.47am gmt
06:47
109th over: australia 323-8 (nevill 37, hazlewood 27) last over hazlewood defended duminy without bother.
this time around, the moment he overpitched he was onto the front dog and slotting him through cover.
that’s his shot.
6.45am gmt
06:45
108th over: australia 319-8 (nevill 37, hazlewood 22) now look, i hate to go on about it.
but this over sums up why yesterday afternoon was such a misstep in going after the runs.
rabada in this spell actually looks tired.
at last.
evidenced by his speed, at least 10-15kph down on what we have become accustomed in this match.
but also when he sprays not one but two wides in the over, bouncers ballooning over nevill.
at this point i’ll simply add, 37 overs remaining.
6.41am gmt
06:41
107th over: australia 316-8 (nevill 37, hazlewood 22) hazlewood looked vulnerable against the turning ball early, but he’s spending the afternoon at rancho relaxo when duminy is at him.
a single to to third man ends the set, but other than that, competent in defence.
updated
at 6.41am gmt
6.38am gmt
06:38
106th over: australia 315-8 (nevill 37, hazlewood 21) a bit going on in that set from rabada, to break up a quiet stretch as these two get stuck in.
first, hazlewood’s edge is clipped, it’s lovely bowling, but is to the ground and the rope.
four scored.
then, a run out chance after hazlewood takes a single out to the deep; nevill is home, but it is sent upstairs to confirm.
it isn’t riveting, i’m not going to lie to you.
but the only relative win australia can take from this is keeping rabada and philander out there bowling for as long as they can.
if that leads them into a final session, well then it gets interesting.
but one thing at a time.
nevill showing why he should be at six.
if he stays seven for hobart, where he's made 235 in a shield game, it would defy all logic #ausvsa
6.32am gmt
06:32
105th over: australia 310-8 (nevill 37, hazlewood 16) spun around is maharaj, now from the lillee-marsh end.
not a long breather for the left arm tweaker.
it’s a maiden to nevill, who has his measure.
gerard whateley on the radio asked by chris rogers about this squad being retained for two tests regardless of the result here.
there’s going to be a lot of scrutiny over this after the test.
“without labouring the point, i think this is way more serious than is being depicted.
this is a three test series, not a six test summer.
if you lose the next test the series is gone.
i would have had that conversation as a selection panel last night.”
6.29am gmt
06:29
104th over: australia 310-8 (nevill 37, hazlewood 16) pretty good over for hazlewood, smashing a bad full toss to the point fence then finishing the over with a little fine leg nurdle.
41 over remaining.
i’m going to start doing that a bit now.
don’t be scared.
6.26am gmt
06:26
103rd over: australia 304-8 (nevill 37, hazlewood 10) rabada is back from the lillee-marsh, something for which we can all be grateful.
but he’s only easing in here.
bowled 28 overs this innings, so you can understand it taking a while to get back to his quickest.
a couple taken by nevill down the ground, a neat little drive.
really enjoying his fight, as i’m sure australian team management are as well.
6.23am gmt
06:23
102nd over: australia 302-8 (nevill 35, hazlewood 10) hands, heads, hands, dropped.
bavuma at short leg can’t hold onto the hazlewood chance, created by duminy who is back into the attack.
won a wicket with his first over this morning, nearly did so again.
and one final mention of the real hero this week’s coverage, oled tvs.
can’t bloody wait to buy one for chrimbo.
he can watch his run out on his oled tv #ausvsa pic.twitter.com/g8qrm0ddfv
6.17am gmt
06:17
101st over: australia 301-8 (nevill 34, hazlewood 10) a maiden from philander to hazlewood leads us into the drinks, half way through the final day at the waca.
all four wickets today have fallen leg before, siddle the man to go so far this session when philander struck the moment he returned with new ball in hand.
quick maths.
44 overs to go.
that’s 264 balls.
so, 132 balls apiece for these two and the test is saved.
easy peasy.
peter nevill showing a lot of fight.
only shaun marsh, usman khawaja faced more balls for australia in perth #ausvsa
6.12am gmt
06:12
100th over: australia 301-8 (nevill 34, hazlewood 10) what a lovely way to bring up the australian 300, nevill down the track and hitting maharaj through the line and along the ground for four.
the only other noteworthy moment of the over was a wide signalled.
and unlike the australian innings where a trio of those were signalled for bouncers that were too high to handle for anyone, this was your more conventional type.
hitting a crack, it turning a long way.
granted, not as far as this from nathan lyon at the same venue three summers ago.
100 overs gone in this second dig now.
45 remaining.
i’m just throwing that in there.
6.08am gmt
06:08
99th over: australia 296-8 (nevill 30, hazlewood 10) hazlewood strokes another boundary, two in as many overs after philander drops short outside the off-stump but with bit less potency than required.
it came the ball after beating him, so it gives a sense of how hazlewood plans to go about this through to the end, whenever that is.
updated
at 6.09am gmt
6.04am gmt
06:04
98th over: australia 291-8 (nevill 29, hazlewood 5) hazlewood gets his big old front pad down to the pitch of maharaj and flays him through extra cover for his first boundary.
nice cricket.
it inspires a chance of direction from the spinner, going left-arm around to the left-handed batsmen.
now sliding away rather than turning in, he beats hazlewood’s bat immediately.
by the end of the over he’s back over the wicket again.
keeping the sightscreen attendant honest, fair play to him.
1400 people here today.
they were letting them in for $20 at the front this morning.
considerably cheaper than normal, so there’s that.
on the other hand, maybe a chance missed to throw the gates open.
5.59am gmt
05:59
97th over: australia 287-8 (nevill 29, hazlewood 1) umpire dar taking a look at the ball between philander deliveries.
hard to know for sure, but i don’t think nevill’s drive to the outfield was sufficient to destroy it quite yet.
they don’t get to change it.
hazlewood will keep the strike for the next over with that legside ring walking back into position.
a bit dreary at the moment, i must admit.
updated
at 6.04am gmt
5.57am gmt
05:57
96th over: australia 283-8 (nevill 26, hazlewood 1) bowling with the new ball, maharaj is sliding into hazlewood then ripping in.
as a result, he is operating with bowl a slip and three men short on the legside.
a real throwback.
the big boy survives a leg before shout to begin the over and gets more confident in defence as the set progresses, and gets off the mark beyond that leg side ring.
worth remembering that hazlewood started his test career with a habit of batting for a long time and not getting out.
not least in dominica last year where he stuck fat long enough to get adam voges from 80-odd to a debut century, significant in the context of that match.
5.52am gmt
05:52
95th over: australia 281-8 (nevill 25, hazlewood 0) nevill persevering here, not much more than that.
an edge to gully begins the over before plenty of defence and a couple of leaves.
sticking around for some red ink here won’t be for nothing.
adam voges said to me in an interview that a big part of getting his belief back as a test player was scrambling to an ugly, unbeaten half century at trent bridge last year, amid the ruin of an ashes loss.
a lesson nevill can draw from.
meanwhile katich again, tapping into a bit of dissatisfaction with the preparation australia had coming into this series: “one shield game before the first test is almost unheard of.”
5.48am gmt
05:48
94th over: australia 281-8 (nevill 25, hazlewood 0) nevill takes one down the ground first ball of the maharaj over to put hazlewood on strike.
but he handles it without any concern.
simon katich is happy with his former nsw teammate: “peter nevill has been impressive, he’s shown a lot of character here.
the resolve you need in these conditions.”
5.46am gmt
05:46
93rd over: australia 280-8 (nevill 24, hazlewood 0) the new bat hazlewood is beaten with the only ball remaining in philander’s over.
some interesting information from ric finlay on the abc.
the hobart test is forecast to begin with rain over the weekend, and through to monday as well.
far from ideal for australia trying to come back from one-nil down.
5.43am gmt
05:43
does not come more out than that.
it may have hit a little crack, but probably didn’t, jagging into his back pad deep in the crease.
the second new ball has struck with immediate effect.
they have a review but he doesn’t even bother.
not long now.
updated
at 5.43am gmt
5.39am gmt
05:39
92nd over: australia 279-7 (nevill 23, siddle 13) maharaj still on, a single taken.
nothing too much going on from his end, but his job to continue doing as he is.
philander back on from the members’ end now, so the new ball can’t be far away in any case.
5.37am gmt
05:37
91st over: australia 278-7 (nevill 22, siddle 13) boom, boom!
no, boris becker isn’t out there, it’s peter siddle starting rabada’s new over with two boundaries.

90th over: australia 270-7 (nevill 22, siddle 5) sure enough, siddle much happier facing the spin of maharaj, capitalising on a short ball that he wallops through the covers to the rope.
a nice way to get off the mark.
after getting off strike, nevill has a couple of balls to negotiate, one of which beats his outside edge.

drawing nevill forward, he’s beaten twice outside the off-stump.
the edge is finally found, but with soft enough hands it lands well in front of the slips cordon.
south africa are still operating with the old ball (the new one was due after the 80th over).
might be time to give rabada a chance with it with him bowling like this.
could finish this in a hurry.

he batted for ages at kandy when australia were (belatedly) trying to hold on there.
he just has that look about him.
and that’s not to say he hasn’t a lot to play for; his spot won’t be without scrutiny if australia lose this series.
siddle ends up on strike after a single to mid-off, surviving an inside edge.

before this test we had convinced ourselves that south africa wouldn’t dare go in with an uncapped spinner and surely they’d play four quicks.
but he’s fit right in.

let’s be hones with each other: this may be a short time, but let’s make it a good one.
adam collins here taking the baton for what is likely to be the final session of this test match.
australia lost three wickets this morning as nicely detailed by sam perry.
usman missed his ton by three when he was trapped in front, mitchells marsh and starc both suffering the same fate.
australia need a million to win (539 to be precise), so let’s ignore that.
alternatively, they can survive two full sessions to save the match on a track going up and down, against an opening bowler in kagiso rabada who looks like he is on the fast track to becoming the best quick in the world.
let’s talk while we’re here.

so the first session concludes with south africa marching confidently towards victory.
australia showed some fight but the procession continued for the proteas as they made sufficient inroads into the australians, leaving them on the brink of a stinging defeat at home.
as with yesterday, kagiso rabada was the destroyer, picking up marsh and starc with deliveries that had the australians beaten for not just pace, but intelligence.
the three-card trick of swinging the ball away again and again before darting one back in with ferocious rapidity served rabada well.
he has been nothing short of a revelation (at least to australian audiences) in this match.
one suspects his life changes a little after this performance.
the australians will be disappointed usman khawaja couldn’t survive until lunch.
he was their only flicker – the only batsman who showed a semblance of control against this skilful attack.
he can, at least, take solace in delivering a test match innings of substance in front of the home audience.
as we head into the second, and surely last, session of this match, we can expect australian recriminations, navel-gazing and consternation.
they may have collapsed astonishingly on day two, but that now doesn’t seem like an aberration.
south africa has truly outplayed australia in all facets of proper test match cricket: they batted with great patience and grit through elgar and duminy specifically, they attacked with vigour through de kock, du plessis has skippered with guile, and the pace bowling has been memorably skilful.
this is to mention nothing of temba bavuma’s ‘worldy’ run out.
to those who stuck with me on debut, thanks.
to those who corrected my grammar throughout, kind regards.
i’ve enjoyed being aboard the good ship obo.
i’ll now leave you in the outstanding hands of adam collins to take you through the post-lunch session.
cheers!

managua, nicaragua —  nicaraguan president daniel ortega won re-election sunday, electoral authorities said, setting the stage for his third consecutive term — this time accompanied by his wife as vice president.
the president of the supreme electoral council, roberto rivas, said late sunday that ortega had more than 71 percent of the votes with about a fifth of the ballots counted.
ortega, who ran with his wife, rosario murillo, as his vice presidential candidate, faced five other lesser-known candidates in an election that critics of the government had called unfairly tilted against the opposition.
emerging with her husband after casting their ballots shortly before the polls closed, murillo called the vote "an exemplary, historic election."
there were no vote counts yet for 92 congressional seats that were also contested sunday.
rivas said 65 percent of nicaragua's 3.8 million registered voters participated in the election.
the opposition, which had urged people to boycott the election, disputed that, contending turnout was low
advertisement
the main opposition movement, the broad front for democracy, said its checks indicated that "more than 70 percent" of voters did not cast ballots.
ortega and his leftist sandinista national liberation front have benefited from the central american country's steady economic growth and low levels of violence compared to neighboring honduras and el salvador.
many nicaraguans also cite the first lady's social programs as a major reason for the governing party's popularity.
but critics accused ortega and his allies of manipulating the political system to guarantee he stayed in power for a new five-year term by dominating all branches of government, allowing indefinite presidential re-election and delegitimizing the only opposition force seen as capable of challenging him.
they said he wants to form a political dynasty together with his wife.
"i don't think it's worth voting and wasting time, because it's already fixed," said glenda bendana, an appliance sales executive in a managua shopping mall.
"here they have taken away not our right to vote, but to choose.
ortega wants to die in power and leave his wife to take his place."
eva duarte castillo, with a degree in marketing, was among those who went to the polls, though she didn't say how she voted.
"i came to vote because it is not only my right as a citizen, it is also my duty.
it is a responsibility and i exercised it.
i'm happy," she said at a polling station in the capital's altamira managua neighborhood.
in july, nicaragua's supreme electoral council effectively decimated the opposition by ousting almost all its members from congress — 28 active and alternate legislators from the liberal independent party and the allied sandinista renovation movement — for refusing to recognize pedro reyes as their leader.
reyes was named head of the opposition by the supreme court but is seen by many as a tool of ortega.
the ousted legislators supported former opposition leader eduardo montealegre.
the most powerful opposition forces moved to the sidelines of the nation's politics, urging nicaraguans to boycott the election, which they called a "farce."
many nicaraguans, including political analyst carlos tunnerman, believed the five other presidential candidates were not true opponents, but were placed on the ballot to make it seem that ortega had legitimate competition.
advertisement
"the only thing they are looking to do is play along with ortega, permitting him to get additional small bits of power in the national assembly, tunnerman said.
candidate maximino rodriguez of the liberal constitutional party rejected that idea, saying, "i only collaborate with the nicaraguan people."
ortega, who helped topple the dictatorship of anastasio somoza as a sandinista guerrilla leader, ruled nicaragua in 1979-1990.
after losing power in a shock electoral defeat, he later returned to the presidency through the ballot box in 2007.
re-election would leave ortega in power but facing an increasingly difficult regional landscape.
leftist ally venezuela is overwhelmed by an economic crisis and cuba is normalizing relations with the u.s.
the u.s. house of representatives has moved to punish nicaragua since the opposition was gutted, passing a bill to require the united states to oppose loans to nicaragua from international lending institutions unless the country takes "effective steps to hold free, fair and transparent elections."
a companion bill was introduced in the u.s. senate.
"the lack of venezuelan support, the international price of oil, the price of our exports and the possibility that (u.s. legislation passes) makes it a more complicated outlook for the ortega in the next term," said oscar rene vargas, a sociologist and economist at central american university.

minneapolis — detroit quarterback matthew stafford said he would like to avoid being down late in the fourth quarter at all costs.
but he certainly looks comfortable in those situations, perhaps because he has had plenty of practice this season.
on sunday, stafford threw a 28-yard touchdown pass to golden tate, who vaulted into the end zone in overtime to give the lions a 22-16 victory over the minnesota vikings.
after matt prater kicked a 58-yard field goal as time expired in regulation, tate finished the opening drive when he ran through arm tackles by xavier rhodes and harrison smith.
“our guys have been able to do it,” lions coach jim caldwell said of his team’s ability to erase fourth-quarter deficits in all five of its victories.
“not just do it once or twice, they’ve been able to do it a number of times.
“i do think they have the level of comfort with it.
it’s a tough situation to be in, but they don’t flinch, and we haven’t had any crucial mistakes in that period of time.”
advertisement
stafford completed 23 of 36 passes for 219 yards, two touchdowns and an interception for the lions (5-4), who have won four of their past five games.
the vikings (5-3) lost their third straight game for the first time since oct. 19, 2014, in coach mike zimmer’s first year, but the offense responded during a tumultuous week characterized by a change in offensive coordinators.
pat shurmur was promoted after norv turner abruptly resigned, citing a difference in philosophy with zimmer about strategy.
“for the first time in three weeks, this team fought like i expected them to fight,” zimmer said.
“if we continue to do these kinds of things, we’ll win football games.”
a concerted effort for sam bradford to make quicker throws with shorter drops to minimize pressure helped him complete 31 of 40 passes for 273 yards, one touchdown and no turnovers.

after having been sacked 11 times over the previous two games, he was sacked only twice.
five players ran the ball.
ten players caught a pass, including bradford on a pass batted at the line.
“everybody is getting their piece of the pie,” said wide receiver stefon diggs, who had a career-high 13 catches for 80 yards.
tyrunn walker blocked a field goal, kerry hyder had two sacks and the lions stuffed the vikings on fourth-and-1 at the detroit 5-yard line in the fourth quarter to keep them in position to rally late.
the vikings took a 16-13 lead with 23 seconds to play on a 1-yard run by rhett ellison.
but stafford hit andre roberts for 27 yards to set up prater’s game-tying kick.
advertisement
in overtime, stafford hit eric ebron for 17 yards on third-and-3, marvin jones drew a pass-interference call on rhodes, and tate polished off the stunner with a hard-nosed catch-and-run down the sideline.
“it was kind of planned,” tate said of his flip.
the vikings were in business in the second quarter when chad greenway intercepted a rushed throw from stafford and returned it to the lions’ 18-yard line.
but the offense committed two penalties and bradford was sacked on third down, turning a first-and-10 at the 18 into a fourth-and-32 from the lions’ 40.
after the vikings punted, stafford led the lions on a 17-play, 84-yard drive that took almost 10 minutes.
he hit anquan boldin for a 1-yard touchdown with five seconds left in the second quarter, giving detroit a 10-3 halftime lead.
according to fox sports, it was the first time a team punted after being inside the opponent’s 20-yard line since st. louis did against washington in 2011.
vikings kicker blair walsh had steadied himself over the previous few weeks after a shaky start to the season.
but the struggles returned on sunday.
he missed his third extra point of the season — most in the n.f.l.
— when he hit the right upright, preventing the vikings from tying the score at 10.
then his 46-yard field-goal attempt in the fourth quarter was blocked by walker.
“you guys are going to ask me this question a million times: ‘did it feel good?’” walsh snapped.
“did i make it?
no.
do i have to?
yes.
do i want to?
yes.
so, just, if you’ve got something else, please.
seriously.”

latavius murray ran for 114 yards and three touchdowns and the oakland raiders showed they were ready for prime time by beating the defending super bowl champion denver broncos, 30-20, on sunday night.
in what was being billed as the biggest game in oakland since the team went to the super bowl following the 2002 season, the raiders (7-2) put together a complete effort to overpower the broncos (6-3) and take over sole possession of first place in the afc west.
derek carr threw for 184 yards and did not turn the ball over, khalil mack had two sacks, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery and the raiders outrushed denver 218-33 behind a dominant performance in the trenches.
the performance was to the delight of an energetic crowd at the coliseum, excited to host a prime time sunday night game for the first time in more than a decade.
after 13 straight seasons without a playoff berth or winning record, the raiders have shown they are ready to contend in the afc in the second season under coach jack del rio.
oakland got off to its best start in 15 years by beating up on lesser teams, but the win over the defending champion broncos showed the progress the franchise has made since starting 0-10 two years ago.
trevor siemian looked shaky at times for denver but did throw two touchdown passes, including a short pass behind the line that kapri biggs turned into a 69-yard touchdown catch and run in the fourth quarter.
but oakland still led by 10 points despite that defensive breakdown and held on for the win.
hefty is "trashing" the campaign, excedrin is curing headaches caused by the caustic debates, and ringling brothers wants to remind the public that it is the real circus, despite what the last few months may have seemed like.
in previous election years, it was not unusual for brands to create ads that lightly poked fun at the political process or went heavy on patriotism and optimism.
now, marketers have a new focus when connecting with voters: fatigue and disillusionment.
"whether you're completely conservative or more liberal, it's kind of like everybody's sick of this conversation and the low trashy depths that this election has gone to," said jason peterson, chief creative officer of havas north america, which oversees hefty's advertising.
people visiting the cnn and fox news websites in the last few days may have noticed stark black banner ads with white letters declaring, "this political ad has been trashed thanks to hefty."
hefty, the trash bag maker, seized on the five days leading up to election day to run such ads across several major political news sites and politics-related videos on youtube.
its hope is to curry favor with americans by shielding them from additional political messaging after a long, vitriolic presidential race.
"people are almost demanding this kind of relief," mr. peterson said.
it is perhaps harder now to make light of the election as businesses have during previous campaigns, as when jetblue offered international trips to voters whose candidate lost, pizza hut stitched together debate clips to highlight how cheap its pizza was or snickers ran cheeky "don't vote hungry" ads.
more from the new york times: the online video view: we can count it, but can we count on it?
for 's.n.l.,' clinton-trump has been a blessing and a curse  look up: in the digital age, billboards are far from dead
tecate, the mexican beer label, was seen as poking fun at donald j. trump with its recent commercial featuring a "tecate beer wall," a knee-high ledge to rest beers on, even though the brand said the ad was nonpartisan.
indeed, the appetite for humor seems low in an environment where both skittles and tic tac had to issue formal statements within weeks of each another distancing themselves from untoward mentions by the trump campaign.
so come the new tactics.
hefty said its digital campaign, which started on thursday and will run through tuesday, was built on the belief that "americans hate political ads."
just last month, the american psychological association said that 52 percent of american adults cited the presidential election as a "very or somewhat significant source of stress" in a survey conducted by harris poll.
and the final pre-election new york times/cbs news poll released late last week showed that more than eight in 10 voters said the campaign had left them repulsed rather than excited.
what investors should watch for in a clinton or trump presidency
discussing the 2016 election season and how investors should position themselves, with terry haines, evercore isi managing director and head of political analysis.
excedrin, on the day of the third and final presidential debate last month, promoted the hashtag #debateheadache on twitter, saying, "debates bring headaches; excedrin brings fast headache relief."
the brand tweeted out statistics from a survey it conducted throughout the day, including one that said 73 percent of americans would experience election-related headaches this year.
the product, given its focus on relieving head pain, doesn't generally have the opportunity to "speak on a larger scale," especially during a presidential election, said scott yacovino, a senior brand manager for excedrin and the united states pain business at glaxosmithkline.
this situation was a "perfect storm," he said.
"even during the first debate, there was a lot of organic chatter around people getting headaches and the election causing headaches," mr. yacovino said.
"we thought we could bring our benefit to folks no matter what their political affiliations are."

another ad campaign born out of election fatigue came from ringling brothers and barnum & bailey last month, which officially denounced the use of the term circus to refer to this year's presidential race.
its social media tracking tool showed that between oct. 15 and oct. 24, the terms "circus" or "clowns" were used to describe the election or candidates an average of almost 4,000 times a day.
as part of its effort to "take back the circus," the company made a humorous video featuring several performers expressing their indignation over misuse of the terms.
in one scene, a ringmaster turned to the camera and said, "people keep calling candidates clowns."
a clown by his side responded, "but we're real clowns, and we take clowning seriously."
hefty's banner ads have appeared on cnn, fox news, aol, and the huffington post's politics page.
hefty's youtube ads will be aimed at people tracking the election, especially in swing states like north carolina and pennsylvania.
the company's agency said its purchase guaranteed at least 40 million page views across the sites.
"we did pick out media buys based upon where more of the trashy politics are going on and more in the swing states where it's getting heated," mr. peterson said.
he added: "what i really love about it and what i think consumers appreciate in advertising is when you're able to offer them a utility to what they're feeling.
and to me, people are sick and tired."

why this investor thinks there will be a year-end rally
frank troise, md at leonteq securities, forecasts a market rally and a december hike of 25 bps from the fed.
markets are due for a rally, as headwinds from the u.s. presidential election weaken, one investor told cnbc on monday.
on sunday, the federal bureau of investigation (fbi) again cleared democratic nominee hillary clinton of potential criminal charges over her use of a private email server for government business while secretary of state.
frank troise, managing director at leonteq securities in singapore, told cnbc's "the rundown" that sunday's news would see a huge sigh of relief, as it would likely swing the momentum back in clinton's favor with just days to go for the election.
"a trump presidency, as it was becoming unbelievably more realistic last week ... was clearly making markets nervous," troise said.
markets sold off last week as the race between clinton and trump tightened, after the fbi first revealed it was looking into a new cache of emails related to the server investigation.
the revelation shook up the election campaign and put gop rival donald trump ahead on some polls.
for months, investors had been pricing in a win by clinton, and the idea that a republican-controlled congress would keep her policies in check.
"the primary concern that the markets were pricing in, believe it or not, was in regards to trade and the implications for trade (under a trump presidency)," said troise, in reference to last week's moves lower.
both trump and clinton oppose the 12-nation trans-pacific partnership (tpp) free trade agreement, with the former calling it the worst deal ever.
in october, trump told an audience in gettysburg, pennsylvania, he would take a tough stance on trade, vowing to renegotiate the north american free trade agreement (nafta).
"this week, however ... we could see a huge relief rally from here through year end," said troise.
u.s futures jumped on monday morning following the fbi's update, with the e-mini dow futures climbing 220 points before slightly trimming gains.
s&p 500 futures and the nasdaq e-mini futures also gained more than 1 percent.

a us-backed kurdish and arab force says it has begun an operation to capture raqqa, so-called islamic state's "capital" in syria.
the syria democratic forces (sdf) will be aided by us-led coalition air strikes.
they have warned civilians to steer clear of areas where is militants are present.
the coalition of kurdish and ethnic arab militias has been gaining ground in areas to the north of the city.
the offensive was announced at a press conference in ain issa, about 50 kilometres (30 miles) away from raqqa.
"the major battle to liberate raqqa and its surroundings has begun," a spokesperson for the sdf said.
brett mcgurk, us president barack obama's envoy to the us-led coalition against is, said: "the raqqa campaign will proceed in phases - very deliberate phases"
"there is an isolation phase which began today and there will be subsequent phases to make sure that that we kick daesh out of raqqa and that will happen," he added, using another acronym for is.
another sdf spokesperson told afp that heavy resistance is expected.
"is will defend its bastion, knowing that the loss of raqqa will mean it is finished in syria," he said.
the operation comes as us-backed iraqi forces continue their campaign to push is militants out of their iraqi stronghold of mosul.
raqqa was named the de facto capital of the "caliphate" proclaimed by is in 2014.
a report by ihs conflict monitor in october 2016 said the jihadists had lost about 16% of the territory they held at the beginning of the year, and that overall they had lost just over a quarter of the territory they controlled in january 2015.
the sdf alliance, which is dominated by the kurdish popular protection units (ypg) militia, has emerged as a key ally of the us-led coalition over the past two years, leading the fight against is on the ground in northern syria.
turkey, syria's closest neighbour to the north, is not expected to take part.
it considers the ypg a terror organisation and says it will not accept a role for the kurds in the liberation of raqqa.
announcing the "wrath of the euphrates" operation, the sdf said they hoped turkey would not "interfere in internal syrian affairs".
of the sdf's 30,000-strong force, up to 25,000 fighters come from the ypg, according to some estimates.
separately on sunday, the us army's highest-ranking general met his turkish counterpart in ankara in a previously unannounced visit.
the meeting between joseph dunford, chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff, and general hulusi akar, was a sign that washington and ankara were in "close contact", mr mcgurk, the us envoy, said in amman.
"we want this to be as coordinated as possible, recognising that there will be a mix of forces on the field and that many of those forces of course do not see eye to eye, but they do share a very common and still very lethal enemy," he added, talking about of is.
the us was keen to launch the raqqa offensive while the operation to retake mosul is under way to stop is fighters retreating from iraq to syria.
but the fight for raqqa will be tougher and longer than for mosul.
syria's warring factions, in their sixth year of battle, are against is but are also fighting each other, distracting them from the jihadists.
iraq has an internationally-backed government army unlike syria, where the regime is opposed by the west.
and turkey's vehement opposition to the syrian kurdish fighters means it will not play a part in the raqqa operation - although it's similarly excluded from mosul because of tension with baghdad.
the kurdish participation is problematic: kurdish fighters are accused of expelling arabs from areas they've taken in the north and raqqa has an overwhelming arab majority.
kurdish troops are fighting turkish-backed arab forces from the free syria army, so there can't be a joint fsa-kurdish offensive.
in short: syria is a mess and nobody expects raqqa to be wrenched from the jihadists anytime soon.
despite turkey's objection to ypg fighters being involved, they are a necessary part of the raqqa offensive, the commander of anti-is coalition forces said.
speaking last week, lt. gen. stephen townsend said: "the facts are these - the only force that is capable on any near-term timeline is the syrian democratic forces, of which the ypg are a significant portion."
"so, we're negotiating, we're planning, we're having talks with turkey and we're gonna take this in steps."

hacking the vote
the department of homeland security has acknowledged hacking attempts on the election systems in 20 states.
we ask cybersecurity expert cris thomas how real the tampering threat is to current election machines.
as americans head to the polls on election day, are hackers also preparing to vote?
some security researchers have found vulnerabilities with the machines some americans will use to vote.
the news comes in a hotly contested election cycle where hacked emails are being deployed furiously in an attempt to sway public opinion.
meanwhile, hackers have already tried to breach election systems in more than 20 states, according to the department of homeland security.
according to experts, the people doing the hacking may not have to try hard.
"the machines themselves physically have been shown to be very vulnerable," cris thomas, a strategist for tenable network security, a maryland based cybersecurity company, told cnbc's "on the money" recently.
in a related development, some machines are using outdated technology.
"the fact is we've been voting on old technology, old windows 2000 based operating systems… the voting machines themselves are archaic having been around for 10-15 years," said congressman hank johnson, a georgia democrat who has sponsored legislation on the issue.
researchers at cybersecurity company, symantec, tracked down voting machines used in the last election, and found plenty of security flaws.
"it literally took a couple of days…we were able to then reverse engineer all the stuff on that system.
what was fascinating is the last election's information was still on those hard drives," said samir kapuria, a senior vice president of cybersecurity for symantec, which makes norton internet security.
one particular machine works by giving voters a card to insert and use to cast their ballot, and the card is reused by multiple voters.
symantec would not reveal the manufacturer of those machines, but said they are still in use.
that card could be reprogrammed to look like the same person cast a ballot multiple times, according to kapuria.
even worse, he says there is no paper trail.
"there isn't a recourse.
that's why it's such a risk…it could create fear, uncertainty, or doubt in the whole election process," kapuria said.
the good news is that there are multiples types of voting systems across the country.
"right now we have over 9,000 jurisdictions all with different types of equipment and that sort of helps promote the resilience of our electoral system," thomas told cnbc.
in addition, most voting systems are not connected to the internet, reducing the possibility of a web-based attack.
"the fact that these machines require physical access to cause harm helps to limit the possibility that there is any nefarious activity going on," thomas said.
overall, while experts believe one machine could be compromised, wide spread hacking is unlikely.
still, government officials are paying attention.
johnson sponsored the "election infrastructure and security promotion act of 2016" (h.r.
6073), which would classify voting systems critical infrastructure.
the bill is currently in subcommittee.
"there are some minimum standards that are in place, but they have not been adjusted for quite a long time," he told cnbc.
"there is always a need for the federal government to continue analyzing, modifying, and putting in place new processes and procedures and standards that will keep up with the changing technology."
in the meantime, there is voluntary assistance for states.
thus far, 48 states have asked the department of homeland security for help, amid widespread cyber breaches that have stoked security concerns.
"we have confidence in the overall integrity of our electoral systems.
...nevertheless, we must face the reality that cyber intrusions and attacks in this country are increasingly sophisticated," dhs secretary jeh johnson, said in a recent statement.
while worries about voting security pop up around election time, expects say the time to act is now to protect the 2020 presidential election.
"starting on november 9, we really need to have a strong national conversation about what we're going to do with our voting systems so that the next election we don't have this same issue" thomas said.

washington —  fbi director james comey told congress in a letter sent sunday that a review of newly discovered hillary clinton emails has "not changed our conclusions" from earlier this year that she should not face charges.
sent just two days before election day, the letter appeared to resolve any lingering ambiguity over the prospect that the democratic presidential nominee could yet face a criminal indictment over her use of a private email sever as secretary of state.
"based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in july with respect to secretary clinton," comey wrote to congressional leaders, less than two weeks after first telling them about a cache of newly found emails that investigators thought might be pertinent to their investigation.
but the letter left unresolved other questions, including the content and number of new emails, and how many of the messages investigators reviewed were duplicates of emails they had already seen.
"the growing number of unanswered questions demand explanations," sen. charles grassley of iowa, the republican chairman of the senate judiciary committee, said in a statement.
advertisement
a senior law enforcement official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal decision-making, said the letter was intended to reflect a conclusion to the email review and not merely a status update.
the letter also drew fresh criticism from lawmakers who said the new email review, announced in a vague letter to congress on oct. 28, shouldn't have been made public so close to the election and created unnecessary suspicion.
"today's letter makes director comey's actions nine days ago even more troubling.
there's no doubt that it created a false impression about the nature of the agency's inquiry," sen. dianne feinstein, d-calif., said.
republican presidential nominee donald trump said clinton was being protected by a "rigged system" and pronounced her "guilty," notwithstanding the fbi's conclusion.
the fbi had been under pressure to reveal additional details about its new email review following comey's abrupt disclosure on oct. 28 that the bureau had discovered emails that were potentially relevant to the clinton investigation.
the emails were found on the computer of anthony weiner, the disgraced congressman and estranged husband of clinton aide huma abedin.
weiner is under investigation by federal authorities for online communications he had with a 15-year-old girl.

upon discovering emails thought to be potentially pertinent to the clinton email investigation, comey advised congress that investigators would review the messages to see whether they were classified.
the fbi subsequently obtained a warrant to begin the process of going through the emails.
that disclosure, made over the objections of the justice department, roiled the presidential race in its final days and revived an issue that the clinton campaign thought had ended over the summer when the investigation closed without charges.
in july, the fbi chief chastised clinton for her use of a private mail server but said the bureau would not recommend criminal charges against the democratic presidential nominee or her aides.
the justice department accepted that recommendation.
advertisement
in his letter to congress on sunday, comey said the fbi had reviewed all new emails to and from clinton and that nothing had changed its july conclusion.
but the letter did not address how the messages wound up on weiner's computer and what, if anything, the announcement means for abedin.
abedin's attorney, karen dunn, has said abedin learned from media reports about the possibility that her emails had been found on a laptop belonging to weiner.
comey has already said that investigators found classified emails on clinton's server, and that although clinton and her aides had been "extremely careless" in their handling of classified information, there was no evidence that anyone had willfully broken the law.
the new email review did not automatically increase the chances that anyone was in renewed danger of criminal prosecution, even if additional classified messages were found.
"we were always confident nothing would cause the july decision to be revisited.
now director comey has confirmed it," clinton campaign spokesman brian fallon said sunday on twitter.

delhi's chief minister has shut all schools in the indian capital for three days as its citizens struggle with choking smog.
after an emergency cabinet meeting, arvind kejriwal promised a raft of measures to combat the extreme air pollution.
all construction and demolition work has been banned for five days in the city.
water will also be sprinkled on main roads to help suppress dust.
mr kejriwal advised delhi-ites to stay indoors as much as possible and work from home if they can.
polluted delhi has 'become a gas chamber'
delhi chokes after diwali fireworks
delhi 'car ban' policy fails to dent pollution
other measures announced by the government include fighting fires at landfill sites, and shutting down the coal-based badarpur power plant.
about 1,800 municipal schools had already been shut in the capital on saturday because of pollution.
the move came after levels of pm2.5 - tiny particles that can clog people's lungs - soared to over 90 times the level considered safe by the world health organization (who) and 15 times the indian government's norms.
hundreds of people wearing face masks held protests at delhi's jantar mantar monument on sunday, sharing their fears and frustrations on social media using the hashtag #myrighttobreathe
india's ndtv quoted an official of the india meteorological department, who said visibility in delhi was just 200m (656ft) at 8.30am local time, "caused by the heavy fog and smoke".
mr kejriwal called on india's national government to help control the smog which has enveloped the city since diwali.
the hindu festival of lights is widely celebrated with fireworks, which release soot and dust into the air.
during the winter months, delhi's pollution is aggravated by many of the city's poor burning rubbish at night to stay warm.
agricultural waste is also set on fire around delhi to clear cropland, and burns for days on end.
technically such fires are banned, but attempts to impose cash fines on farmers who break the law have done little to stop them.
delhi's air pollution levels have been a concern for some time, and the indian capital has vied with beijing for the unwanted title of "world's most polluted city".
the delhi government has tried various schemes to contain the problem, including a crackdown on diesel vehicles, and a car rationing scheme where those with odd and even registration numbers were banned from the roads on alternate days.
air pollution is a leading cause of premature death in india.
who figures show that about 620,000 people perish every year from pollution-related diseases.

cleveland —  hillary clinton is pulling out the big guns for her final swing through the crucial battleground state of ohio.
or at least the very, very tall ones.
basketball great lebron james joined clinton at a campaign event in cleveland on sunday, dwarfing the democratic candidate as he pushed ohioans to support her at the polls.
as a child growing up in inner-city akron, the nba star (height: 6'8") said he believed "our vote doesn't matter."
"but it really does," he said.
standing beside — and somewhat below — james, clinton praised his work on the basketball court and for improving the lives of children through his family foundation.
"what he does off the court is to care for every child as though that child is his own," she said.
clinton added:  "i will be on your side.
i will fight for you."

though she's spent most of her campaign running as president barack obama's successor, vowing to continue the first black president's legacy, clinton has struggled to motivate black voters.
in early voting, they've turned out in lower numbers than the record black turnout in 2008 and 2012 that helped fuel his historic candidacy.
the slump could hurt her in swing states, like ohio and pennsylvania, where urban, black turnout is crucial for democrats.
on sunday morning, clinton stopped by an african-american church in solidly democratic northwest philadelphia to warn parishioners that "everything" they care about is on the ballot.

"this election is about doing everything we can to stop a movement to destroy president obama's legacy," she told voters at mount airy church of god in christ.
but her team feels particularly concerned about ohio, where polls show her in a dead heat with her republican rival, donald trump.
on friday, she appeared at a free concert featuring rapper jay z and his wife, beyonce carter knowles, in cleveland.
lebron, who helped end cleveland's championship drought earlier this summer by winning a title with the cavaliers, endorsed clinton last month in an op-ed article, where he argued she would be a champion for children and improve life for african-americans.
a father of three, james said he returned to ohio from the miami heat in 2014 with two missions: to win a championship and help area children.
"only one person running truly understands the struggles of an akron child born into poverty," wrote james, who grew up poor in that city and has started a foundation to improve educational outcomes for at-risk children in his hometown.
he campaigned for obama in 2008.
james isn't the only athlete weighing in on the 2016 race.
golfer john daly, former football star herschel walker, former professional wrestler hulk hogan and former basketball coach bob knight have endorsed trump.

campaigning for hillary clinton at a florida baseball stadium, president obama lamented sunday that the  nature of this year’s presidential race has become so negative that even "saturday night live" this week couldn't keep parodying it.
what bothered him most, the president said, was the way "stuff that’s not normal, people have been treating like it’s normal."
he referred to how just days ago he encouraged people at one of his rallies to show respect for a donald trump supporter who came to protest the event.
but trump claimed just hours later that obama had yelled at the man.
"didn't just make it up, but said the exact opposite of what had happened, with impunity," he said.
"there was tape.
there was a video....
he thought it was ok just to lie in front of all his supporters.
"that says something about how unacceptable behavior has become normal," obama added.
“and that's why he is uniquely unqualified to hold this job.
the good news is, all of you are uniquely qualified to make sure that he doesn't get the job!"
obama also mocked trump after a report that his own campaign apparently had taken away his access to twitter, where trump has been known to send insulting missives.
"if somebody can’t handle a twitter account, they can’t handle the nuclear codes," obama said.
it was a typically chesty speech from the outgoing commander in chief as he not only stumps aggressively for hillary clinton to succeed him, but settles some scores with the republicans who have tried to stifle his every move for eight years.
in his reelection campaign four years ago, obama would talk somewhat optimistically — in retrospect, perhaps naively — about his view that republicans who had opposed him in his first term would be more cooperative should he win a second.
knowing he would not be on the ballot again, there was less political incentive to deny him policy victories, and perhaps political incentive to try to find common ground, he thought.
“the fever will break,” he would say back then.
“c'mon, man,” has become his head-shaking credo now.
obama on sunday again attacked republicans who support trump even though they hold private — and some even public — reservations about him.
he also warned that electing a republican congress would lead to a continuation of the obstruction he's faced.
"they're suggesting they might impeach hillary.
they don’t know what for yet.
but they’re thinking about it," obama said.
gridlock, he continued, is not "some mysterious fog that descends on washington," or something equally the fault of democrats and republicans.
"you want some more endless gridlock, vote for republicans.
you want an america that can do better … then you need to vote for democrats up and down the ballot," he said.
sen. marco rubio (r-fla.) has emerged as one of obama’s favorite targets, an example of a republican whose devotion to defeating democrats sometimes supersedes his personal and policy convictions.
rubio supports trump now, obama said, even though he called trump a con artist while running against him for the gop nomination.
"he tweeted, 'friends don’t let friends vote for con artists,'" obama said.
"guess who just voted for trump a few days ago?
marco rubio.”
rubio's opponent, rep. patrick murphy, appeared before obama on sunday.
"if you want a senator who will say anything, do anything, be anybody just to get elected, then that’s your guy," obama said of rubio.
"if you want a senator who will show up and work for you and tell you the truth, then vote for patrick murphy and give hillary some help."
obama made just one stop sunday here in central florida, a key swing area in the always-important battleground state.
"we win this election if we win florida," obama said.
"if we win florida, it's a wrap."
monday he has three appearances scheduled, in michigan, new hampshire and pennsylvania.
he will join clinton at the latter.

ryanair has raised its long-term traffic forecast by 10% and predicts it will be carrying more than 200 million passengers a year by march 2024.
the airline said it believed it could deliver profitable growth across europe "despite the uncertainty of brexit".
however, the uk's vote to leave the eu meant that ryanair had reduced its planned uk growth in 2017 from 12% to about 5%.
the news came as ryanair reported a 7% increase in first-half profits.
it made €1.168bn (£1.04bn; $1.29bn) in the april-to-september period, which it described as "a strong first half".
however, it warned: "weaker air fares and brexit uncertainty will be the dominant features of [the second half of the year]."
in morning trading, ryanair shares rose 4.9% to €13.40.
last month, ryanair reduced its forecast for full-year profits, blaming the drop in the pound following the brexit vote.
it said at the time that net profit would be €1.3bn to €1.35bn (£1.17bn-£1.2bn), 5% below its earlier guidance.
in its latest statement, the airline said it remained "comfortable" with that figure, but said that was heavily dependent on avoiding adverse declines in airfares during the fourth quarter.
it already expects revenues from fares to fall in the second half of the financial year by 13% to 15%.
ryanair chief executive michael o'leary told the bbc that business was "booming", but that the environment was "bearish" after the brexit vote.
as a result, the airline was cutting its fares to encourage more people to travel.
"it's bad news for my shareholders, but great news for my customers," he said.
mr o'leary said the british government had "no idea" about how to deliver brexit.
he accused prime minister theresa may of "faffing around in india", where she is currently on a trade mission, instead of heading to brussels, where the future shape of brexit would be decided.

as the world gathers in morocco for the historic first meeting under the paris agreement – called “cop22” but now also “cma1” – it does so with the unprecedented involvement of corporate interests who have fought climate action around the world, funded climate change denial and whose fundamental interest is in extracting and burning as much fossil fuel as possible.
earlier this year, desperate moves from countries representing the majority of the world’s population to examine how the un might identify and minimise conflicts of interest were swept under the carpet by rich countries – especially the us, eu and australia – who argued they wanted to be as “inclusive” as possible and that the concept of “conflict of interest” was too hard to define.
as a result, representatives of companies such as exxonmobil, chevron, peabody, bp, shell and riotinto will have unquestioned access to most discussions in marrakech, will be called upon for advice and will be walking the corridors and holding private discussions with countries that are trying to move the world to stop consuming the products those companies have based their businesses on.
the bodies through which those companies access the cop22 meetings have been detailed in a chart created by corporate accountability international.
groups such as the world coal association, the business council of australia, business europe and business roundtable will represent the world’s biggest fossil fuel companies in the meetings through their “observer status”.
jesse bragg from corporate accountability international says it is clear those groups are driven by a profit motive and not by the desire to curb carbon emissions, and so have a conflict of interest.
“it’s hard to believe the world coal association is having conversations with delegates, encouraging them to more strictly regulate the coal industry,” bragg says.
“that’s completely against their interests.
so what is their purpose in that space other than to continue to extract and burn coal?”
bragg says those groups have a role to play in the implementation of the rules set by nations but no legitimate role to play in the setting of the rules themselves.
the role many fossil fuel companies play in policy debates as the world attempts to curb carbon emissions has been clear:
in a striking irony, the climate change cop at which these corporate interests will be welcome will happen at exactly the same time as another un cop, where the exclusion of corporate interests has been hailed as a fundamental ingredient to its success: cop7 of the framework convention on tobacco control, starting today in delhi, india.
at that meeting, a report will be presented analysing the impact of the tobacco control treaty.
it concludes the fctc “has contributed to significant and rapid progress” in tobacco control action.
part of the fctc – article 5.3 – says that “parties shall act to protect these policies from commercial and other vested interests of the tobacco industry in accordance with national law”.
the treaty recognises that “there is a fundamental and irreconcilable conflict between the tobacco industry’s interests and public health policy interests.” it then goes on to recommend almost no contact with the tobacco industry, except when necessary to implement regulation of their products.
“it’s pretty much the most important aspect of implementation,” says mike daube from curtin university in australia, of article 5.3.
daube was the deputy chairman of the committee that wrote the report on the impact of the tobacco control treaty.
“it essentially says that governments should only speak with the tobacco industry when they absolutely have to and do so holding their nose and washing their hands afterwards,” daube says.
despite the strong acknowledgement of corporate conflicts of interest in that un treaty, rich countries have argued strongly against any measure to limit corporate involvement in the implementation of the paris agreement.
in may, the like minded group of developing countries (lmdc) – a collection of more than 20 countries representing most of the world’s population – pushed for an report to be prepared examining how “the united nations system and other intergovernmental forums … identify and minimise the risk of conflicts of interest”.
far from a radical call for governments to distance themselves from the fossil fuel lobby, it merely asked for a report on how conflicts of interest have been dealt with in other forums.
but that request was deleted from the final report from the meeting and a “technical glitch” meant an objection raised by ecuador on behalf of the majority of the world’s population was ignored.
the venezuelan delegation spoke strongly about the issue:
the convention and the paris agreement is an instrument between states.
and the inclusion of non-state actors must go through a revision of conflict of interest.
this is a standard request, a legal request and a moral request.
it is unacceptable for our delegation that the concept of conflict of interest was not even considered as the fundamental basis for the ethical integrity and the effective implementation of the paris agreement … it is a concern for the majority of the world represented here at this conference and the discussions in the contact room.
we are astonished that this issue was completely overturned in the conclusions.
but the eu, australia and the us rose to speak against any exclusion of fossil fuel lobbyists.
the australian delegation framed the issue as one where developing countries were trying to make the process less “open”, despite supporting measures in the tobacco control treaty to lock out the tobacco industry:
parties are merely the custodians of this issue.
australia cannot and will not support an approach under the unfccc that will lead to us trying to block people from having access to what we do here.
we operate under the basis … of openness and inclusiveness and transparency.
australia also argued the concept of “conflict of interest” itself was too hard to define, despite the issue being grappled with in many other forums:
there is no clear understanding of what a conflict of interest is and it means different things to different people.
the us delegation also framed the issue as one where they were trying to be as inclusive as possible.
“we oppose constraining ngo participation in the unfccc process,” the us delegation said.
besides having access to meetings as observers, with no conflict of interest screening, the unprecedented level of corporate influence on the implementation of the paris agreement was formalised in the global climate action agenda, through which corporations who make carbon-cutting pledges get high-level access to the meetings, can organise side events in the “civil society village”, promote their products in a “gallery” and sponsor the conference.
kingsley faulkner is the deputy president of the australian council of smoking and health as well as the national chair of doctors for the environment australia.
faulkner says the exclusion of the smoking lobby from tobacco control forums was essential and that there are clear parallels to the fossil fuel lobby.
“bodies that make these decisions should be looking very seriously at who they allow into the policy-making groups and see in whose interests they are talking,” faulkner says.
“and if you do that, of course, you clamp down on the fossil fuel lobby.
“there are a number of real examples where industries have huge influence on public policy, to the detriment of the health of the community.
“if politicians are serious about saying their first priority is the security and the wellbeing of the community then they’re going about it in a bad way if they allow the fossil fuel lobby to put that at risk.”

london — against a backdrop of rising political acrimony, theresa may, the british prime minister, warned critics on sunday not to thwart her timetable for withdrawal from the european union, as she prepared for a standoff with lawmakers that could prompt calls for an early general election here.
mrs. may, who wants to start the formal process of leaving the bloc by the end of march, now has a serious fight on her hands, after several months of facing relatively little challenge over her plans for british withdrawal, known as “brexit.”
judges on britain’s high court ruled last week that she could not start exit negotiations by invoking article 50 of the european union’s treaty without first consulting parliament, where the government’s majority is slim.
the government is appealing the case to the supreme court, but if it loses, and then finds itself constrained by lawmakers, the temptation to seek an early general election may become overwhelming for mrs. may.
advertisement
for now, the government is playing down that prospect.
mrs. may insisted on sunday that she had a mandate to pursue britain’s exit without consulting parliament.
in a referendum in june, about 52 percent of voters elected to quit the bloc.
“the british people, the majority of the british people, voted to leave the european union,” mrs. may said at heathrow airport as she left for a trade mission to india.
“the government is now getting on with that.”
after the court ruling, however, mrs. may now knows there is a good chance that she may not be able to do so with the free hand that she wants.
so far she has specified almost no detail about her objectives, arguing that she wants to keep her negotiating position as strong as possible.
at the heart of the dispute lies an ambiguity inherent in a referendum that asked voters to say whether they wanted to quit the european union but that did not seek their views on what relationship should replace it.
supporters of brexit contend that opponents now want to thwart the will of the people as expressed in the referendum.
critics fear that the government has no coherent brexit strategy, and worry that the country may lurch into a damaging economic rupture with the bloc, which voters did not endorse.
on sunday, gina miller, the founder of an investment management firm who was the lead claimant in the legal case against the government, told the bbc that mrs. may must take the decision to parliament “because we do not live in a tin-pot dictatorship.” ms. miller said she had faced online death and rape threats over the case.
nigel farage, the interim leader of the u.k.
independence party, which campaigned for british withdrawal, warned of protests in the streets if the decision in favor of brexit was ignored.
“believe you me, if the people in this country think they’re going to be cheated, they’re going to be betrayed, then we will see political anger the likes of which none of us in our lifetimes have ever witnessed in this country,” he said.

the court ruling has unleashed an ugly political discourse, with one tabloid newspaper that supported brexit describing the judges who delivered the verdict as “enemies of the people.”
several months on, little is clear.
britain’s trading relationship with the e.u.
looks to be in limbo.
companies are reassessing their long-term investments in britain.
here’s what’s happened so far.
while the government has said it defends the independence of the judiciary, it has not rushed to condemn the newspaper coverage, prompting criticism from some senior legal figures.
more worrisome for mrs. may is the parliamentary math should she be forced to take her case for british withdrawal to lawmakers.
last week, david davis, the secretary of state for exiting the european union, conceded that if the appeal to the supreme court failed, the government would probably have to put forward legislation to trigger article 50.
that could give opponents the possibility to amend it, and tie down its negotiating stance.
in an interview with the sunday mirror, the leader of the opposition labour party, jeremy corbyn, said he would push for mrs. may to adopt his “brexit bottom lines.”
“we are not challenging the referendum,” he said.
“we are not calling for a second referendum.
we’re calling for market access for british industry to europe.”
the party’s deputy leader, tom watson, took a more lenient position.
he told the bbc that labour was “not going to hold this up,” and that “article 50 will be triggered when it comes to westminster.”
asked about the possibility of a general election, the health secretary, jeremy hunt, told the bbc on sunday that it was “the last thing the government wants” — a formulation that does not specifically exclude it happening.

swansea, wales — the protests started even before the humiliation was done.
zlatan ibrahimovic had yet to score his second goal, which would be manchester united’s final one in a 3-1 victory over swansea city on sunday, but already the dull hum of mutiny flickered around the losing team’s liberty stadium.
the songs began in the corner of the east stand, where swansea’s most vocal supporters are corralled.
each chant was greeted with a ripple of applause from the rest of the stadium.
“we want our club back,” the first chorus went.
the second demanded that “greedy” members of the board leave the club.
a third suggested an explicit use for “dollars,” an allusion to the recent american takeover of the team.
bob bradley, swansea’s american manager, heard what he called the “back and forth” but tried to shut it out of his mind and focus on the game unfolding in front of him.
the fans kept voicing their dissent as manchester united waltzed through, almost unchallenged, once more.
advertisement
over the last decade or so, swansea has been british soccer’s feel-good story, with an improbable rise that seemed to belong to another age.
the tale proved so irresistible that it even made it onto celluloid.
advertisement
that movie, “jack to a king,” depicts a club saved from financial ruin by lifelong fans and then lifted from oblivion and into the elite by a succession of young, imaginative managers preaching an adventurous style of play.
it is, strictly speaking, a documentary, but it follows the narrative arc of a romance.
for a while, it seemed that swansea would have its happily ever after.
in 2013, the club won its first major trophy in more than a century of existence, prevailing in the english tournament now known as the efl cup.
the following season, the team, not far removed from the threat of extinction, earned a rare spot in one of the prestigious european competitions, the europa league.
that was only two years ago, but it seems like a lifetime.
devotion, all of a sudden, is in short supply in this corner of south wales.
managers have come and gone with alarming, uncharacteristic frequency: michael laudrup, garry monk and francesco guidolin, who yielded to bradley last month.
cornerstone players have departed.
new owners — steve kaplan and jason levien, american sports executives — have arrived.
the mounting discontent among supporters suggests that rapid change has not been universally welcomed.
results make it hard to disagree: swansea has not won a game since the opening day of the season; bradley has picked up just 1 point from his first four matches in charge.
the club is 19th in the premier league, with the same point total as rock-bottom sunderland.
the threat of relegation to a lower division is very real.
who is to blame is not entirely clear.
the accusations of greed might have been directed at kaplan and levien, seen as speculators coming to profit from others’ hard work.
or the song might have been meant for huw jenkins, the chairman, and a number of other directors who made millions from the club’s sale this year but retain their places on the board.
who will play the role of lightning rod, though, is not in question.
bradley has spent much of his career awaiting a chance in the premier league.
now he has it, and he is getting the full experience: not just the full stadiums, the razzmatazz and the chance to pit his wits against the likes of josé mourinho and arsène wenger, but the politics, the impatience and the cutthroat darwinism, too.
wisely, he chose to avoid the issue of the protests, insisting after the match that the only way to “win the support of the fans is to play better and take points.”
advertisement
he added, “the players, the coaches, the professionals — we have to focus on the only part we can control.”
bradley, though, will not be afforded the chance to be neutral.
to some fans, he is a manifestation of the second transformation in swansea’s recent history.
after its gleeful metamorphosis into a premier league fixture, there is now the grudging mutation from local institution into international concern.
it is bradley’s nationality that condemns him.
danny gabbidon, a former wales international, said on the radio after the game that the accent of bradley, a new jersey native, meant that he “could not take him seriously.” one fan, as the game petered out, loudly suggested that bradley was “out of his depth.”
by that point, a goal from the dutch defender mike van der hoorn had given the final score a veneer of respectability for swansea and muted the worst of the dissent for the final 20 minutes of the match.
the lull will not last.
some fans are convinced that swansea is managed by an american because it is owned by americans.
to them, bradley is a reason for unrest, not a victim of it.

there are holes in this particular plotline.
swansea’s dramatic elevation was characterized by stability.
from 2007 to 2014, swansea employed four managers: roberto martínez, paulo sousa, brendan rodgers and laudrup.
each joined a club with a clear vision of not only where it was going but also how it wanted to get there.
since laudrup’s acrimonious exit, swansea has had four managers in less than three years.
the smoothness, that production-line mentality in which the club rolled on regardless of the man on the sideline, has long since disappeared.
in december, monk, a former player, was replaced by alan curtis, a trusted coach and local hero, on a temporary basis because the board did not have a successor in mind.
guidolin, an experienced italian, eventually took the post — after not working for two years.
he was hardly an obvious extension of swansea’s reputation for stylish play.
advertisement
the players like bradley and enjoy his training sessions, and the club’s staff members admire his insatiable work ethic, but the concerns about guidolin apply to him, too.
whatever else he is, and whatever his passport says, bradley is not cast from the same mold as martínez and rodgers.
that does not mean he will be a failure, of course, and it does not mean he should be run out of town.
but it does speak of a club that has, somehow, lost its sense of self.
that development, most likely, lies at the root of the discontent among swansea’s supporters.
swansea won admiration during its romantic period because of what it stood for: the idea that fans could run a club, and run it well; the belief that style could bring success.
now, that story has ended, but nothing has emerged in its place.
swansea was different; now it looks like any other premier league club, owned from afar, its only ambition to survive, thinking from one game to the next.
wins would lift the pressure from bradley, but they may not heal the deeper rift.
what the club that wrote a tale worthy of a film needs, more than anything, is another script.

a magnitude 5.0 earthquake has shaken central oklahoma, leading to reports of “significant damage” to buildings and a gas leak.
the us geological survey reported the earthquake struck at 7:44pm cst, with an epicenter located one mile west of cushing, about 50 miles northeast of oklahoma city.
it initially measured the quake at a magnitude of 5.3.
cushing, which has a population of about 7,900, bills itself as the pipeline crossroads of the world.
it is home to the cushing tank farm, a massive oil storage facility that’s touted as the world’s largest.
m5.3 #earthquake (#sismo) strikes 92 km ne of oklahoma city (#oklahoma) 28 min ago.

the quake was felt as far away as kansas city, missouri, and little rock, arkansas.
the cushing police department reported “quite of bit of damage” from the earthquake and said parts of downtown were being evacuated due to gas leaks.
cushing high school announced it would be closed on monday.
images on social media showed major damage to buildings.

the oklahoma corporation commission said it and the oklahoma geological survey were investigating after the quake, which struck at 7:44 p.m. and was felt as far away as iowa, illinois and texas.
“the occ’s pipeline safety department has been in contact with pipeline operators in the cushing oil storage terminal under state jurisdiction and there have been no immediate reports of any problems,” the commission’s spokesman, matt skinner, said in a statement.
“the assessment of the infrastructure continues.”
a 4.5 magnitude earthquake struck the northern part of oklahoma last week, with an epicenter near pawnee.
scientists have linked oklahoma’s sharp increase in earthquakes to the underground disposal of wastewater from oil and gas production.
the oklahoma corporation commission has shut down some disposal wells and ordered a reduction in the amount of wastewater disposed of in others.

• chris smalling and luke shaw missing from back four in win at swansea• ‘great football people will say many times they played without being 100%’
stuart james at the liberty stadium
sunday 6 november 2016 19.02 gmt


last modified on monday 7 november 2016 09.13 gmt
josé mourinho has questioned the willingness of some of his manchester united squad to play through the pain barrier, with luke shaw and chris smalling appearing to be among those the manager had in mind when he expressed his frustration and insisted that mentalities would have to change.
although united beat swansea city 3-1 to win for the first time in five premier league matches, mourinho was clearly annoyed that he had to name a makeshift back four in which ashley young played at right-back and matteo darmian at left-back.
before the match the united manager ran through the team news with mutv and said: “smalling doesn’t feel that he can play 100% with his pain, luke shaw told me this morning that he was not in the condition to play, so we had to build a defensive line.”
rather pointedly mourinho added: “daley blind has some problems but he put himself available to be on the bench and to try to help the team, so the people that are here are people that i trust for a difficult match.”
asked about those comments after a game in which zlatan ibrahimovic scored twice and paul pogba got the first as united raced into 3-0 lead before half-time, mourinho said: “in every sport – and i know because i have friends and they play at the highest level in other sports – how many times you play and you are not 100%.
i have a friend that is a big tennis player, he tells me he remembers more the times he played with pain than the times he played without any pain.
to compete you have to go to the limits.
it’s a cultural thing for some and that’s not my culture.
“there is a difference between the brave, who want to be there at any cost, and the ones for whom a little pain can make a difference.
if i were to speak with the many great football people of this team, they will say many times they played without being 100%.
for the team you have to do anything, that is my way of seeing [things].
“of course, it is not just the players, it is the players and the people that surround the players.
yes, it takes time [to change] but with the help of people like phil jones, who was playing without having even trained, ashley young, wayne rooney, with these people it will not be an impossible mission but a possible mission.”
mourinho was asked whether the players he was referring to would have to change to play for him.
“exactly,” he said, before quickly adding: “more than me, [for] man united.”
otherwise it was a highly satisfactory afternoon for mourinho as united climbed up to sixth in the table, with ibrahimovic scoring his first premier league goals in almost two months.
“i think it will do nothing [for him].
he is not a player who lacks confidence,” mourinho said.
“i used to say that a striker that doesn’t score goals and does nothing else is one player less.
a striker that doesn’t score goals but does everything else is a very important player for the team.”
hong kong police fired pepper spray at protesters on sunday, as hundreds of activists rallied outside the office of beijing's representative in the territory to demonstrate against the central government's impending legal intervention to curb a fledgling independence movement.
minor scuffles broke out as some protesters hurled bottles at police, some armed with batons.
at least one protester was arrested.
around 20 protesters were hit with pepper spray, some protecting themselves with umbrellas - the symbol of the 79-day street protests that rocked hong kong in 2014.
"this is about our future," said one teary eyed young woman.
a ruling on monday from a top committee of china's parliament, the national people's congress, is expected to effectively bar the recently elected lawmakers yau wai-ching, 25, and baggio leung, 30, from taking office.
the pair set off a fierce debate when they pledged allegiance to the "hong kong nation" and displayed a "hong kong is not china" banner during a swearing-in ceremony for the city's legislative council in october.
their oaths were not accepted and their right to re-take them is being challenged in the local courts by the hong kong government.
the congress's standing committee is not waiting for the judgment, however.
it has discussed invoking its rarely used power to interpret hong kong's mini constitution, the basic law, to stop them taking office.
lawmakers quoted on cctv over the weekend described the pair as a threat to china's sovereignty and security.
the situation is seen among many across hong kong's legal and political elites as one of the biggest tests the global financial hub has faced since its handover to china, with some fearing its vaunted rule of law is under threat.
britain returned hong kong to chinese control in 1997 under a "one country, two systems" formula that gave the territory  wide-ranging autonomy, including judicial freedom, under the basic law.
earlier, thousands of protesters marched from wan chai to the city's central financial district, with several hundred pressing on to beijing's liaison office.
organizers put the numbers at 11,000; police said 8,000 turned out.

rotterdam, netherlands —  justin bieber's "beliebers" helped turn him into the biggest winner sunday at the mtv ema european music awards.
again.
bieber, who carried away the most silverware at the mtv emas last year with five awards, won best song this time around for his smash "sorry," and also took away the title of best canadian act.
his army of so-called beliebers earned him his third crown of the night, biggest fans, in online voting via twitter and instagram that closed shortly before the show started.
bieber was one of the many winners on the night who did not attend the show.
just two days ahead of the u.s. presidential election, veteran punk rockers green day closed the raucous show with their anti-establishment anthem "american idiot."
"it is nice to be out of america just for a second because of this horrendous election that is going on right now," lead singer billie joe armstrong said.
the band was honored with the mtv global icon award, but lost out to twenty one pilots in the best live category and to coldplay in best rock.
twenty one pilots also won the best alternative category.

lady gaga, also among the absentees, won best female and best look.
the awards were colored purple this year to honor the late prince.
"prince, we will always miss you," presenter bebe rexha said early in the show as purple spotlights crisscrossed the ahoy arena in rotterdam.
shawn mendes gave his mom a shoutout after winning the best male category.
"my mom's birthday is today, so happy birthday mom, i love you," mendes said.
another canadian took best video, with the weeknd featuring daft punk winning for starboy.
dutch dj martin garrix kept the home crowd happy by picking up two awards — best electronic and best world stage — and teamed up with rexha to perform a duet of "in the name of love."
rexha also provided one of the more surreal performances of the night by singing her single "i've got u" while dancing on and around a giant faux-fur letter u, complete with eyes that followed her moves.
after a rainy day in rotterdam, onerepublic got soaked by a man-made shower on stage while performing their new song "let's hurt tonight."
beyonce was tied with bieber for the most nominations — five — leading into the awards show, but was shut out.
queen bey was in good company; britain's adele was up for four awards, including best song for her single "hello," but also failed to pick up a single prize.
on saturday, the kings of leon kicked off the mtv ema weekend in rotterdam with an intimate gig at the dutch city's old luxor theater.
playing a mix of old favorites and tracks from their recently released album 'walls', the u.s. musicians entertained a packed crowd that included "game of thrones" actress sophie turner who was dancing in the aisles with singer and actor joe jonas.

the fbi says it has found no evidence of criminality in a new batch of hillary clinton emails.
fbi director james comey said in a letter to congressmen the agency had finished its review and found nothing to alter its original conclusion.
mrs clinton's communications director jennifer palmieri told reporters aboard her campaign plane "we are glad the matter is resolved".

jerusalem —  israel's leader says he expects the next american administration to back israel's approach to peacemaking regardless of who is elected president.
benjamin netanyahu tells his cabinet sunday he expects to united states to stay loyal to its longstanding support for the israeli-palestinian conflict being resolved through "direct negotiations without preconditions, and of course not by decisions of the u.n. and other international institutions."
previous rounds of negotiations over the establishment of a palestinian state have broken down and left outbursts of violence in their wake.
israel opposes foreign initiatives to pressure it into concessions and accuses the u.n. of an anti-israel bias.
israel was most recently outraged by a unesco world heritage committee resolution that it said ignored judaism's deep ties to a jerusalem holy site.

it was much ado about nothing, but it certainly amounted to something.
while fbi director james comey, in effect, said "never mind" with regards to hillary clinton's emails, for the past two weeks the story has dominated the political conversation, and democrats have paid a price.
while mrs clinton's standings in the polls have stabilised a bit, talk of a possible clinton rout are a distant memory and many of democrats running on the ballot alongside mrs clinton have seen their standing diminished.
as the campaign comes to a close, the clinton campaign will likely tout these results and try to focus back on its closing message.
chances are donald trump will continue to accuse mrs clinton of corruption, and he has already started once again alleging that the fbi is rigging the system to cover up for the former secretary of state.
with only two days until voting, it's more than likely that the dust kicked up by this story won't have fully settled by the time americans head to the polls.
when determining the political fallout of this latest development, it's worth remembering that the race between mr trump and mrs clinton was already tightening in the days leading up to the first comey letter.
surveys taken after the revelation indicated that few americans considered the story grounds for changing their vote.
the divide between the two candidates is simply too great to allow much ticket-switching at this point.
what the story did do was knock mr trump out of the headlines for over a week, giving him space to bring disaffected republicans back into the fold.
it also prevented mrs clinton from ending the campaign on a positive message and increased negative perceptions of her, which will make it harder for her to govern if she is elected.
once this election is in the rear-view mirror, there will have to be a lot of soul-searching within the fbi and the media about how this story has played out and been covered.
following mr comey's original letter, the nation's top law-enforcement became a constant source of leaks, as internal factions and disputes spilled into public view.
many pundits and analysts speculated that there would be no way mr comey would release the letter so close to the election unless mrs clinton's situation was truly dire.
those conclusions proved unfounded.
if mr trump wins, many will attribute it to mr comey's actions and subject him to withering criticism.
they will point to the fact that he disregarded longstanding justice department policy of restraint when it comes with the release of possibly inflammatory information in the months before a general election.
if mrs clinton prevails, she likely will bear a grudge that is difficult to let go.
the clintons have long memories.
if the tensions between the obama justice department and the fbi have been high, they will only get higher.
either way the fbi director will have quite a mess to clean up.
hillary clinton blames her shock election defeat on interventions by fbi director james comey.

republican candidate donald trump was briefly rushed off the stage by secret service agents at a rally in reno, nevada, in a false alarm.
a man holding a sign saying republicans against trump was tackled by security agents, after shouts that he had a gun.
mr trump returned to the stage at saturday's rally minutes later.
the republican candidate says he is going to target states seen as democratic strongholds ahead of tuesday's election.
latest on sunday's campaigning
both candidates have been making late changes to their travel schedules as falling poll numbers for mrs clinton in some key democratic-leaning states present what the trump campaign sees as new opportunities.
however, a new nbc/wall st journal opinion poll on sunday suggested a four-point lead for mrs clinton.
the latest washington post/abc tracking poll puts her lead at five points.
sunday's campaign stops take mrs clinton to ohio, michigan, pennsylvania and new hampshire, while mr trump travels to iowa, minnesota, michigan, pennsylvania and virginia.
on saturday evening, mr trump had stopped speaking at the reno rally after seeing something in the auditorium.
he was grabbed by two agents, who rushed him off stage, while the protester was held down and searched.
when he resumed his speech, mr trump said: "nobody said it was going to be easy for us...
i want to thank the secret service."
the secret service later confirmed that someone in front of the stage had shouted "gun", but that "upon a thorough search of the subject and the surrounding area, no weapon was found".
austyn crites, the man at the centre of the disturbance, said he was attacked when he brought out his sign.
"i keep repeating - i'm down, someone is trying to choke me - and i'm saying to these people; 'there is no gun, i just have a sign'," mr crites explained after the incident.
on sunday, donald trump's campaign manager, kellyanne conway, told cnn the protester was a "democratic plant or operative", although she offered no details.
for a moment here in reno, a political campaign simmering with tension and bubbling with resentment boiled over.
as shouts of "gun" rang out and donald trump was hustled from the stage there was panic at the front of the packed hall.
some people dived to the floor, others ran for the exits.
a few journalists who left the media pen and headed towards the commotion were treated to manhandling and verbal abuse.
there was no gun, of course, and the drama quickly subsided.
drowned out by the commotion was an allegation of ballot-rigging which mr trump had made a few minutes earlier.
the republican claimed that some early voting stations in nevada had been kept open "for hours and hours beyond closing time" to allow democratic voters to be brought in by bus.
it was a reminder that this election is already well under way.
more than 40 million americans have voted early.
in states which can provide a path to the white house, the data suggests that hillary clinton has the edge.
but history is littered with errant polls and, as we saw today in reno, unpredictable events.
hillary clinton's chief strategist, john podesta, said on sunday that she would focus on nevada and michigan, adding that if she won those two in particular, "hillary clinton is going to be the next president of the united states."
mr podesta also accused mr trump of being an advocate of russian foreign policy and rejecting the bipartisan us approach.
republican vice-presidential candidate mike pence told fox news sunday that mr trump would accept a clear outcome of the election, although he reserved the right to challenge disputed results.
in the final tv debate with mrs clinton, mr trump had refused to commit to accepting the result if he lost.
on saturday evening, mrs clinton appeared with katy perry at a rally in philadelphia, pennsylvania, where the democratic presidential candidate urged the crowd to vote.
"when your kids and grandkids ask you what you did in 2016," mrs clinton said, "i want you to be able to say, i voted for a better, stronger, fairer america."
perry, who took to the stage to sing the song nasty, said she was looking forward to election day.
"tuesday's going to be fun," she said, "but wednesday is going to be better".
mrs clinton has seen her lead slip following last week's fbi announcement that it was looking into emails that may be connected to her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.
more than 40 million early voters have already cast their ballots.
reports suggest many more latino voters are turning out early in battleground states including florida, arizona and nevada compared to past elections.
donald trump told a rally in tampa, florida, on saturday he was "going into what they used to call democrat strongholds, where we're now either tied or leading.
we're going to minnesota, which traditionally has not been republican at all".
pennsylvania and michigan are also both on his agenda and they too have been tough states for republicans.
they have not won them since 1988.
florida is an important state, particularly for mr trump, with many seeing it as a must-win.
candidates need 270 electoral college votes to win the presidency.
florida is worth 29 and polls suggest the contest is tight.
who is ahead in the polls?

hillary clinton

"florida, here we are again, right back where we started," writes anthony man of south florida's sun-sentinel newspaper.
despite daily visits from presidential candidates or their running mates and more than $115m (£92m, €103m) spent on tv ads, the sunshine state "is essentially tied and remains the biggest swing state prize" on the eve of the election, as predicted months ago.
the new york times focuses its attention on latino voters turning out in large numbers to cast their ballots early, which it calls "a demonstration of political power that lifted hillary clinton's presidential hopes and threatened to block donald j trump's path to the white house".
nonetheless, in an editorial, the paper looks towards "the catastrophe that looms if we wake up wednesday morning to president-elect trump".
over at breitbart, the most-read conservative news website in the us, patrick howley writes that donald trump is "even surprising the press with his high energy in the final hours of his battle to reclaim american sovereignty".
in north carolina, "trump tore into clinton with the clear-eyed precision of a master political assailant".
as the campaign enters its final two days, "to win, mr trump needs a whole lot to go right.
and to lose, clinton needs a whole lot to go wrong," writes kyle cheney at politico.
in many key states mr trump is travelling to this weekend, "millions have already voted early and opportunities to change the campaign's fate are dwindling quickly".

while the u.s. election is set to hog the limelight this week, investors will likely take some time analyze key chinese data for signs the country's economic health is on the mend.
while economists appear split on how the trade reading would look, expectations are for some pick-up in consumer and production inflation.
the world's largest exporter will reveal trade figures for october on tuesday (november 8), and some economists expect imports to fare better than in previous months.
"most indicators suggest that domestic demand is still improving and import values will also benefit from the latest step up in commodity prices," julian evans-pritchard and chang liu, economists at capital economics, said in a recent note.
capital economics forecast imports would return to positive territory, growing 2 percent on the previous year, but that exports would decline 7 percent on-year.
china's growth has stabilized: stanchart
the economy is doing better but internal housing market reform might result in a growth slowdown in the longer term, says stanchart's eric robertsen.
september trade data came in markedly below expectations; exports plunged 10 percent in dollar terms and imports slipped 1.9 percent, resulting in a trade surplus of $41.9 billion, down 29.5 percent from the previous year.
"a sudden turnaround this month (for exports) seem unlikely, (however) stronger growth in developed markets ... should at least prevent shipments from slipping further," evans-pritchard and chang said.
barclays' economics research unit, however, were less optimistic, saying in a friday note that they expected china's exports to fall 6 percent year-on-year due to base effects.
the consensus forecast for exports stands at 5.8 percent.
base effects refer to the impact an unusually high or low inflation result in the previous month has on the reading.
on wednesday (november 9), china will release its consumer price index (cpi) and producer price index (ppi) for october.
"consumer price inflation in china is picking up again, mostly because of a food price spike," moody's analytics economists said in a note on friday.
"that said, non-food inflation also shows signs of upward pressure, as the disinflation from energy fades and as the housing market heats up," the economists added, forecasting cpi would rise by 2.1 percent, in line with the consensus estimates.
most economists also expect inflationary pressures to show in producer prices.
"the strengthening in the ppi is likely to have been driven by rising commodity prices, which will have a further positive impact on industrial profits," economists at anz research said in a friday note.
the overall steel price index rose 23.6 percent on-year in september, and in the same month coal prices also recorded their first positive on-year growth in three years, the anz economists said.
anz research expected ppi to rise 0.8 percent, below market consensus of a 1 percent increase.

police have charged todd kohlhepp, the man arrested after a woman was found "chained like a dog" on his property in south carolina, with four counts of murder.
kohlhepp told police when questioned on saturday that he was responsible for the deaths of four people shot at a motorcycle shop in 2003.
he has confessed to seven murders in total.
on sunday, investigators found remains of another body at kohlhepp's property.
registered sex offender kohlhepp, 45, has also been charged with kidnapping.
"there's no wondering about it anymore," said spartanburg county sheriff chuck wright, referring to the 2003 killings.
kohlhepp told investigators that he shot and killed the owner, service manager, mechanic and bookkeeper of the motorcycle shop, providing details "only the killer would know", officials said.
they expect further charges to be brought after kohlhepp showed law enforcement officers where he said he had buried two other victims from separate incidents at his property.
on sunday, investigators uncovered human remains at one of the two locations provided by kohlhepp.
on identifying the remains and cause of death, mr wright said: "we're not even close."
the latest discovery comes after police, acting on a tip-off by a sex-crime investigator, visited kohlhepp's property on thursday and found a woman in a metal container.
she had been missing since late august, along with her boyfriend, whose body was discovered at the 95-acre site in woodruff, 80 miles (130km) northwest of the state capital of columbia, on friday.
the woman, who was employed by kohlhepp, a property agent, to clean houses, told officers that he had shot and killed her boyfriend in front of her.
she said she arrived at his woodruff property with her boyfriend to help clean it when kohlhepp pulled a gun on them, reports cbs news.
families of the victims of the 2003 shootings faced kohlhepp for the first time on sunday when he appeared at a court hearing in spartanburg, south carolina.
when asked by judge jimmy henson whether he had any statement to make, kohlhepp replied: "not at this time, sir."
judge henson thanked the families for their civility and composure.
"i know there's a lot of hurt, beyond what a lot of people understand," he said.
the murder charges against kohlhepp have opened old wounds for the families haunted by the slayings at the motorcycle shop.
the killings stunned the state of south carolina and left the victims' parents and partners clueless about a possible motive.

a magnitude 5.0 earthquake has shaken central oklahoma, causing damage to some structures.
the u.s. geological survey reported the earthquake struck at 7:44 p.m. central time, with an epicenter located one mile west of cushing, about 50 miles northeast of oklahoma city.
the usgs initially stated it was a magnitude 5.3 earthquake but lowered that rating to 5.0.
the quake was felt as far away as kansas city, mo., and little rock, ark.
the cushing police department reported "quite of bit of damage" from the earthquake but details were not immediately available.
photos posted to social media show piles of debris at the base of commercial buildings in the city.
cushing, which has a population of about 7,900, bills itself as the "pipeline crossroads of the world."
it is home to the cushing tank farm, a massive oil storage facility that's touted as the world's largest.
according to usgs data, there have been 19 earthquakes in oklahoma in the last week, including a 4.5-magnitude quake that struck the northern part of the state, with an epicenter near pawnee.
scientists have linked oklahoma's sharp increase in earthquakes to the underground disposal of wastewater from oil and gas production.
the oklahoma corporation commission has shut down some disposal wells and ordered a reduction in the amount of wastewater disposed of in others.

beirut —  u.s.-backed syrian forces on sunday said they would march on the northern city of raqqa, the de facto capital of the islamic state group's self-styled caliphate.
the offensive promises to divert is fighters from mosul, the much larger extremist-held city in northern iraq, which has been the target of a massive operation launched by baghdad last month.
but long-running tensions between turkey and the syrian kurdish-led forces leading the assault on raqqa could complicate the battle and buy is more time.
a closer look at what the new offensive means:
who is leading the offensive?
the kurdish-dominated syria democratic forces have emerged as one of the principal players in the country's multi-sided civil war.
they are recognized by the u.s. as one of the most effective fighting forces against is and have captured large swaths of northeastern syria from the extremists.
the force is dominated by the kurdish party of democratic unity, or pyd, which aims to defend kurdish areas of syria.
despite occasional flare-ups, the pyd has had a tacit non-aggression pact with the syrian government since the start of the civil war, and is seen by some rebels as a quiet ally of president bashar assad, accusations the pyd denies.
___
why might turkey object?
turkey views the pyd as an extension of the kurdish insurgency raging in its southeast, and often speaks of the pyd and is as similar threats.
advertisement
turkish forces and thousands of allied syrian opposition fighters launched their own offensive in northern syria earlier this year, clashing with both the pyd and is.
turkish president recep tayyip erdogan has suggested his own forces and allies should liberate raqqa, and has also demanded a greater role in mosul, angering iraq.
the u.s. wants all of its allies to set aside their grievances, at least temporarily, and focus on is, but a series of visits by top officials in recent weeks has yielded no major breakthroughs.
turkey has yet to comment publicly on the raqqa offensive.
___
how soon until raqqa is freed from is?
the raqqa offensive is likely to take months, and the sdf has said the early stages will focus on sweeping the countryside on its outskirts and gradually isolating the city.
the sdf says it has 30,000 fighters assigned to the campaign, but senior sdf officials have warned progress would be halted if turkey and its allies advance on other kurdish-held territory.
if mosul is any indication, the battle for raqqa will be a long and grinding one.
nearly three weeks after launching the long-awaited push on mosul, iraqi forces have only entered the eastern edge of the city, and have met with stiff resistance in the form of suicide car bombs, rocket attacks and booby-trapped buildings.
___
would the loss of raqqa mean the end of is?
the loss of raqqa would deal a major blow to the extremist group.
raqqa is the seat of power for its self-described caliphate and is likely home to top is leaders.
it is also where the militants are believed to have plotted attacks on western nations, including last year's assault on paris.
but is has already begun preparing its followers for the potential loss of territory, and if it is driven from raqqa and mosul it will likely return to its insurgent roots.
as forces close in on the two cities, many fighters are expected to melt into the civilian population, with some forming so-called "sleeper cells" that could hatch new attacks.
advertisement
___
what about syria's civil war?
the war between syrian president bashar assad and the rebels fighting to unseat him is centered on the divided northern city of aleppo, where is has no presence.
the government and its ally russia have vowed to launch a new push to retake eastern aleppo, held by the rebels since 2012.
if that succeeds, it would free up thousands of government forces that could be sent to other fronts, perhaps to battle is.
but since the start of the conflict, assad and his allies have been more focused on battling syrian rebels, who are concentrated in the country's main cities in the west, than the islamic state group.
that's unlikely to change, especially if other forces are willing to battle the extremists.

china’s parliament on monday effectively banned two pro-independence legislators from taking office in hong kong, an unprecedented move that followed violent protests and stoked fears that the semi-autonomous territory’s relative independence is at risk.
the national people’s congress standing committee, in a rare interpretation of hong kong’s constitution, declared the city’s legislators must take their oaths “sincerely and solemnly,” and condemned separatist discussions as “dividing the country.”
officials responded to behavior last month by the democratically elected legislators during their swearing-in ceremony.
sixtus leung, 30, and yau wai-ching, 25, unfurled a banner that read “hong kong is not china” and pledged allegiance to what they called the “hong kong nation.”
china will “firmly confront the pro-independence forces without any ambiguity,” li fei, chairman of the congress’ basic law committee, said in the great hall of the people on tiananmen square, the symbolic center of china.
two newly elected pro-democracy lawmakers defied an order wednesday barring them from taking their oaths after being disqualified earlier for insulting china, sparking more unruly scenes in hong kong's legislature.

two newly elected pro-democracy lawmakers defied an order wednesday barring them from taking their oaths after being disqualified earlier for insulting china, sparking more unruly scenes in hong kong's legislature.
after yau wai-ching and sixtus leung of the youngspiration party entered the legislative...
concerns about the congress’ decision drew thousands into the streets on sunday, leading to late-night clashes with police.
many viewed the act as an attempt to bludgeon a growing independence movement in the territory.
police used pepper spray; protesters used bricks.
authorities arrested four people during a nine-hour standoff.
a former british colony of 7.3 million people, hong kong was returned to china in 1997 under an arrangement known as “one country, two systems.” this allowed the city to keep a “high degree of autonomy” and its legal system, guaranteed by a mini constitution known as the basic law.
mainland legislators on monday issued an interpretation of that law, saying lawmakers who fail to take an appropriate oath of allegiance will be barred from office and face legal repercussions.
beijing intervened before a hong kong judge could determine whether the duo should retake the oath.
this marks only the fifth time that beijing has interpreted the law since it reclaimed authority over the territory nearly two decades ago.
and it underscores how chinese leaders have come to view hong kong independence movements as a growing threat to national stability.
“this move should be able to stop once and for all pro-independent elements from using [hong kong’s legislature] as their platform,” said lau siu-kai, vice president of the china assn.
of hong kong macao studies, a pro-beijing think tank.
but chinese pushback — such as clampdowns on taiwan’s push for independence — has often had the opposite effect and emboldened a once fringe camp.
many residents worry that beijing is tightening its grasp on the territory and undermining its affairs.
five booksellers who sold publications critiquing the mainland have disappeared over the last year and reappeared in chinese custody.
“even though advocates of hong kong independence remain a vocal minority, it can’t be extinguished by beijing,” said johnny lau, a hong kong-based commentator and veteran reporter on politics on both sides of the taiwan straits.
“and it may yet become radicalized, given the opportunity.”
though many residents desire greater autonomy, a much smaller group clamor for independence.
some view the two legislators as vanguards; others see them as troublemakers.
sunday night’s protests ended outside the central government office, with activists shouting “hong kong independence.”
they had the faint echo of protests two years ago, when hundreds of thousands staged a months-long demonstration for greater democracy.
it failed.

china appointed a new finance chief on monday at a key time as investors' concerns grow over the country's mounting debt and rising fiscal deficits.
xiao jie, former tax chief and minister of finance deputy minister, was named minister of finance, the official xinhua new agency said on monday.
xiao, 59, currently deputy secretary general of the state council, replaces lou jiwei, who had served as finance minister since march 2013.
how concerning is china's debt picture?
china's increasing levels of debt-to-gdp, especially by state-owned enterprises or corporates, could lead to a hard landing, says swiss re's kurt karl.
china also named chen wenqing as the new chief of the secretive ministry of state security, as well as a new head of civil affairs, at the closing of a regular session of the standing committee of china's parliament.
xinhua did not say why the ministers had stepped down but lou is 65.
china's overall debt has jumped to more than 250 percent of gdp from 150 percent at the end of 2006, the kind of surge that in other countries has resulted in a financial bust or sharp economic slowdown, analysts say.
china's local governments are in the midst of refinancing trillions of yuan in debt as some face falling revenue and rising deficits.

miami gardens, fla. — kenyan drake, a rookie kick returner for the miami dolphins, was delighted to find himself at the bottom of a pile of players on sunday, because they were teammates in the end zone.
drake prompted the celebration when he went untouched on a 96-yard kickoff return with 5 minutes 15 seconds left, the final swing in a seesaw game as the miami dolphins beat the jets, 27-23.
an offside penalty had forced the jets to kick off a second time, and drake made them pay.
the dolphins (4-4) won their third game in a row while the jets (3-6) fell deeper into last place in the a.f.c.
east.
jay ajayi came up short in his bid to become the first n.f.l.
player to have three consecutive 200-yard rushing games, but he managed 111 yards and helped to run out the clock after the dolphins came from behind for the third time.
a botched dolphins punt led to an 18-yard touchdown pass to jalin marshall from ryan fitzpatrick that put the jets ahead, 23-20, with less than six minutes to play.
the jets then pinned miami’s jakeem grant deep on the ensuing kickoff, but antonio allen was flagged for being offside.
advertisement
on the rekick, the weary coverage team found itself chasing a fresh drake, grant’s backup.
he sped past the final jet — kicker nick folk — and into the clear.
“i was trying to remember what my track coach said: to keep those knees up,” drake said.
even his teammates gave chase.
“everyone was running down the sideline,” ajayi said.
“i was trying to beat him to the end zone.
i was so excited for him.”
the jets hurt themselves with four personal-foul penalties, two interceptions thrown by fitzpatrick and numerous squandered chances.
fitzpatrick missed four plays midway through the second half because of a left knee injury and was replaced by bryce petty.
fitzpatrick wore a brace when he returned.
he said he would have a magnetic resonance imaging exam monday.
ajayi was hit behind the line on many of his 24 carries but gradually wore down the jets and had 55 yards in the fourth quarter.
“i’m never going to go away from him,” miami coach adam gase said.
“his job is to keep hammering it.”
also impressive with his ball-carrying skills was the dolphins’ jordan phillips, a 335-pound defensive tackle who leapt over an opponent during a 17-yard interception return to set up a field goal.
advertisement
“looked like he wanted to be a hurdler,” his defensive line teammate ndamukong suh said.
fitzpatrick had a pass intercepted in the end zone by bobby mccain in the fourth quarter, and he missed an open brandon marshall in the end zone, forcing the jets to settle for a field goal.
“we had opportunity after opportunity and didn’t get it done,” said fitzpatrick, who completed 17 of 28 passes for 193 yards.
“it all falls on the quarterback.
there’s a lot of things i could have done better today.”
the same went for the jets’ defense: linebacker jordan jenkins dropped a potential interception with nothing but 85 yards of grass in front of him.
the jets were amped up at the start to stop ajayi — but perhaps too much so.
ajayi lost 3, 1 and 5 yards on his first three carries.
but two of the losses were negated, by an unnecessary roughness penalty on buster skrine and a taunting penalty on calvin pryor.
on his fourth carry, ajayi found a big hole and ran 20 yards for a touchdown to put miami ahead, 7-3.
the jets’ sheldon richardson was flagged for unnecessary roughness twice in the second quarter.
richardson and a fellow jets defensive lineman, muhammad wilkerson, sat out the first quarter and entered the game at the start of the second.
a team official said their absences at the start were not injury-related but declined to say whether they were for disciplinary reasons.
“coach’s decision,” coach todd bowles said.
a version of this article appears in print on november 7, 2016, on page d3 of the new york edition with the headline: one mistake too many leaves jets on poor end in a reversal of fortune.

rams defensive linemen heard cam newton loud and clear.
the carolina panthers quarterback last week complained publicly and to nfl commissioner roger goodell about alleged illegal hits in the pocket that have not been called penalties.
he said he did not feel safe and that the situation was taking the fun out of the game for him.
in the days leading up to their game against the panthers, the rams said they would continue to play aggressively.
on sunday, they sacked newton five times in a 13-10 defeat at the coliseum.
aaron donald had two sacks, and cam thomas, eugene sims and mark barron one each.
“of course everybody talked about it,” sims said when asked about newton’s complaints.
“we had fun with it.
“they only scored one touchdown and that was it, so i think we affected him.”
said defensive end robert quinn: “we’d like to get the ball out and score on defense, but we rattled him in the pocket to give ourselves a chance.”
newton completed 20 of 32 passes for 225 yards, including a touchdown pass to tight end greg olsen.
newton complimented the rams defensive line.

“i don’t think they get enough credit for how good those guys are,” he said.
dropped opportunity
tight end lance kendricks had another big game, catching seven passes to tie the career best he set against the new york giants in london two weeks ago.
kendricks totaled 90 yards, including a 25-yard catch over the middle with 9 minutes 30 seconds to play.
but it was the one that got away that kendricks will remember most.
four plays after his 25-yard catch, on a third and goal from the seven, quarterback case keenum found kendricks wide open on a stop route at the goal line.
just as kendricks turned, the ball hit him in the chest and bounced to the ground.
the rams had to settle for greg zuerlein’s 25-yard field goal that cut carolina’s lead to 10-3.
“he put some mustard on that thing,” kendricks said of the pass.
“i was trying to read the coverage, i was running the right route.
the ball was on me, but i still have to make the catch somehow, i have to come down with it.
that’s what being a pro is.
you have to make the tough ones.”
coach jeff fisher seemed a little perturbed when asked about kendricks’ drop.
“tough catch, ball surprised him,” fisher said.
“lance had [seven] catches, tough catches, and we’re going to bring up the drop?
that’s tough on lance, but the ball was thrown in a good position.”

streak ends
zuerlein was a question mark coming into the season after he made only 20 of 30 field-goal attempts in 2015.
he entered sunday’s game 10 for 10, including one from 54 yards against buffalo.
but he missed two of three attempts against the panthers, both from 55 yards.
after the opening drive stalled at the panthers’ 37-yard line, fisher opted for the field-goal try rather than punt.
zuerlein’s kick had enough distance, but missed wide right.
“i felt like we were going to need points and greg felt really comfortable there,” fisher said.
“he just miss-hit it.”
zuerlein’s second miss, at the end of the first half, also sailed wide right.

a joint kurdish-arab militia has begun a new phase in the operation to dislodge the islamic state from its stronghold in raqqa, syria, moving to encircle the city and largely cut off the resupply of arms, supplies and fighters, american military officials confirmed on sunday.
defense secretary ashton b. carter said on sunday that he welcomed the start of the militia’s operation.
“the effort to isolate, and ultimately liberate, raqqa marks the next step in our coalition campaign plan,” mr. carter said in a statement.
american warplanes are flying bombing missions against the islamic state’s “leadership, command and control, and resources” in raqqa and outside the city in support of the militia, the syrian democratic forces, said col. john dorrian, a military spokesman in baghdad.
colonel dorrian said in an email that it might be some time before the 30,000- to 40,000-member force reached raqqa, and that the american-led coalition would continue to train and recruit more forces — especially arab troops — for an eventual attack on the city.

by supporting the advance on raqqa, american officials are sweeping aside objections from turkey and moving forward with plans to rely on a ground fighting force that includes kurdish militia fighters in syria.
the turkish government, which has become a complicated ally in the fight against the islamic state, fears that aspirations for autonomy will spread among its own kurdish population.

in a move to assuage turkish concerns, gen. joseph f. dunford jr., the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, made a previously unannounced visit to ankara, the turkish capital, on sunday for talks with his turkish counterpart, hulusi akar, in part to consult on battle plans for raqqa, according to general dunford’s spokesman, capt.
greg hicks.
the turkish ministry of foreign affairs could not be reached for comment on sunday, but last month ankara asked washington to exclude the syrian kurdish militias from the operation to liberate raqqa, saying turkey was ready to provide military support.
last month, president recep tayyip erdogan said he had told president obama in a phone call that turkey was capable of ridding raqqa of the islamic state by itself.
turkey wants to start the push on raqqa after operations in iraq, including the offensive against mosul, have been completed, the deputy prime minister, numan kurtulmus, said at a news conference last week.
france on sunday supported the decision to begin the battle against the islamic state’s headquarters in raqqa while the iraqi-led offensive on mosul is underway.
“i believe it will be necessary,” the defense minister, jean-yves le drian, said on europe 1 radio.
united states military officials said the raqqa operation was being undertaken in roughly three phases.
phase 1 is what the american-led coalition has been doing for months: conducting scores of preparatory airstrikes in and around raqqa to knock out command-and-control and fighting positions and other assets of the islamic state, also known as isis or isil.
“they don’t have the ability to move large troop formations, large convoys, but they do have the ability to move into and out of the area,” colonel dorrian told reporters in washington last week.
“what we’ve done to try to limit that is we’ve conducted a lot of strikes on their favored supply routes and infiltration routes.”
phase 2, which the syrian democratic forces announced on sunday, is the campaign to isolate raqqa.
the aim is to cut it off from resupply with the available forces — about two-thirds of them syrian kurds and one-third syrian arabs, pentagon officials say.

“the intent, though, is to intensify that effort, to move closer to the city, to envelop the city and then once everything is in place, to liberate it,” colonel dorrian said last week.
phase 3 will be a fight for raqqa itself, which american officials say they hope will be conducted mostly by syrian arabs, given that the city is majority sunni arab.
but colonel dorrian said that might not happen for some time.
“right now, i don’t think that all the forces that’ll be involved in that liberation campaign for raqqa are yet trained,” he said.
colonel dorrian said that providing additional training to militia members who had already been involved in the fighting would take about two weeks.
“we’ll let that play out, and we’ll see how long that takes, and we’ll see how many forces will be generated,” he said.
more than 300 members of the united states special operations forces are in syria advising the kurdish-arab coalition forces, but colonel dorrian said the syrian opposition forces would dictate the timing of the ground operations and training, and the recruitment of additional arab troops for the recapture of raqqa.
“there is an intent to enlarge the force, and in particular the arab contingent of the force, because we do understand that raqqa is primarily an arab city,” colonel dorrian said.
“we do understand that there is a political dimension and a local acceptance dimension to this fight.”
senior pentagon officials have stressed for weeks that the fight to retake raqqa should begin soon — within weeks — to disrupt planning believed to be underway there to stage terrorist attacks on the west.
lt. gen. stephen townsend, the top american military commander in iraq, has declined to name a specific threat emanating from raqqa against western targets but described a general “sense of urgency.” he told reporters at the pentagon two weeks ago that it was imperative that operations to isolate the city began soon to prevent attacks on the west that could be launched or planned from the militants’ capital.

general townsend stressed that kurdish militia fighters would be a major part of the ground force used to isolate raqqa, despite turkish objections.
“we’re going to go with who can go, who’s willing to go soon,” he told reporters during a video news briefing from baghdad.
“and then, once we get the initial isolation in position, we’ll look at how we prosecute the operation further.”
while the kurdish militia will make up the bulk of the operation, general townsend said, many of the united states special forces troops in syria would help recruit, train and equip local forces in and around raqqa, predominantly syrian arabs.
gen. joseph l. votel, the commander of american forces in the middle east, has acknowledged the challenges of dealing with two pivotal allies in the fight against the islamic state in syria who essentially loathe each other — the turks and the syrian kurds.
one of his main goals now, he said recently, is to maintain momentum and “to keep everyone moving in the right direction.”

baghdad —  iraq's special forces worked sunday to clear neighborhoods on the eastern edge of islamic state-held mosul as bombings launched by the extremist group elsewhere in the country killed at least 20 people.
here is a look at the main developments on the 20th day of the mosul offensive:
offensive slows
the mosul offensive has slowed in recent days as iraqi forces have pushed into more densely populated areas, where they cannot rely as much on airstrikes and shelling because of the risk posed to civilians, who have been told to stay in their homes.
some civilians are fleeing the combat zone, while is militants are holding others back for use as human shields, making it harder for iraqi commanders on the ground to get approval for requested u.s.-led coalition air strikes.
iraq's special forces are some of the country's best troops, but they still largely rely on air support to clear terrain.
on the southern front, iraqi forces are still some 12 miles (20 kilometers) from the city center, battling for the town of hamam al-alil.
kurdish peshmerga fighters launched mortar rounds and fired heavy artillery at the is-held town of bashiqa, about 8 miles (13 kilometers) northeast of mosul.
raqqa operation
iraqi forces could receive a much-needed boost by the opening of a new front against is in syria, where a u.s.-backed and kurdish-led force says it will march on raqqa, the extremist group's self-styled capital.
advertisement
the offensives against mosul and raqqa, the two largest cities still under is control, would proceed in tandem, likely forcing the extremists to split their forces between two crucial battles.
but the operation in syria could escalate tensions with turkey, which views the syrian kurdish forces leading it as an extension of the insurgency in its southeast.
is strikes elsewhere
the extremists meanwhile struck far from the front lines with a series of bombings.
the deadliest attack took place in the city of samarra, 60 miles (95 kilometers) north of baghdad, which is home to a major shiite shrine.
provincial spokesman ali al-hamdani said the attacker set off a bomb-packed ambulance in a parking lot near shiite pilgrims before detonating his explosives vest.
the attack killed 11 people, including at least four iranians, and wounded up to 100 other people.
another suicide attacker rammed an explosives-laden car into a busy checkpoint outside the city of tikrit, killing at least nine people.
is claimed all three bombings and said the ambulance bomb was set off by a second suicide attacker.
in the capital, baghdad, a series of smaller bombings killed at least 10 people and wounded 21 others, according to police and medical officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters.
no one immediately claimed the attacks, but they bore the hallmarks of is.

the fbi's much-trumpeted new scrutiny of emails related to hillary clinton has turned up nothing that would cause the bureau to recommend charges against her, the bureau's director, james b. comey, has told congress.
nine days after rocking the presidential race with word that a new trove of emails had been discovered, comey sent a brief letter to capitol hill that, in effect, put an end to the renewed controversy.
the letter said that agents "have been working around the clock to process and review" the emails, which had been found on a computer owned by former rep. anthony weiner, the estranged husband of clinton's close aide huma abedin.
"during that process, we have reviewed all of the communications that were to or from hillary clinton while she was secretary of state," comey wrote.
"based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in july with respect to secretary clinton."
in july, comey sharply criticized clinton for being "careless" in handling classified materials but said there was no basis for bringing any criminal charge against her.
a law enforcement official familiar with the matter said that almost all of the emails found on weiner’s computer were either duplicates of messages the fbi already had reviewed or were personal in nature.
none rose to level that would cause agents to reconsider whether clinton or her aides had knowingly mishandled classified information, the official said.
clinton’s campaign quickly expressed satisfaction with the announcement.
“we are glad this matter is resolved,” said the campaign’s communications director, jennifer palmieri.
but the news from the fbi seems unlikely to calm the anger of many democrats who have called for comey to resign.
his announcement that the emails had been discovered had violated justice department rules designed to prevent investigative actions from influencing elections, many prominent democrats have said.
even if clinton wins the presidential election, many democrats fear that the controversy set off by comey’s announcement, which dominated news coverage of the campaign for the past week, had damaged their prospects in several close senate races that could determine control of the chamber.
comey was appointed by president obama in 2013 to a 10-year term as head of the fbi.
he prides himself on his independence and tangled with the white house in his previous job, as a senior justice department official in the george w. bush administration.
the fact that comey is a republican, however, coupled with a seeming deluge of leaks damaging to clinton from current or former fbi agents in recent days, has caused concern among many democrats.
the substance of comey’s announcement was not surprising — although the timing was.
former government officials and outside legal experts with knowledge of the case had said in recent days that the chances were slim that any of the newly found emails would change the fbi’s previous conclusions.
bringing a charge would require finding evidence that clearly demonstrated that clinton or her aides knowingly broke the law, exchanged materials they knew to be classified or attempted to interfere with the investigation by withholding or destroying evidence, according to former federal prosecutors and legal scholars.
during its nearly yearlong investigation of clinton’s email practices, fbi agents already had interviewed dozens of witnesses, conducted forensic tests and examined tens of thousands of messages.
in that previous phase of the investigation, the bureau had discovered information that officials said should have been considered classified in 193 emails that were part of 81 email chains.
eight of the chains should have been treated as top secret, the highest level of classification, the fbi reported.
none of the emails was marked with a classified header, however, and officials said they had not turned up evidence that clinton or her aides had known that the information was considered classified.
indeed, state department officials continue to dispute whether at least some of the messages should have been considered classified at all.

the rams' dropped to 3-5 after losing to the panthers, 13-10.
they've lost four in a row, so why isn't jared goff, their top pick in the nfl draft, playing?
the rams' dropped to 3-5 after losing to the panthers, 13-10.
they've lost four in a row, so why isn't jared goff, their top pick in the nfl draft, playing?
the rams fell in love with jared goff last spring when they went to berkeley to work him out at cal.
even though it was raining, and he was given a chance to postpone, goff wanted to throw.
the foul weather didn’t scare him.
well, this is a downpour now.
after four losses in a row and the season slipping away, the rams need to budge off their stubborn stance and give the no.
1 overall pick a chance.
at 3-5, what have they got to lose?
keenum will be a free agent after this season; goff is the future of the franchise.
the coliseum crowd was itching to see the rookie sunday as the rams’ offense sputtered with case keenum at the helm, generating 191 yards in the first three quarters of a 13-10 loss to carolina.
the rams, showered with boos and chants of “we want goff,” didn’t even reach the red zone until the fourth quarter.
coach jeff fisher said he heard the boos but not the chants for goff.
he said keenum was not the reason the rams lost.
in his news conference after the london loss, fisher announced he was sticking with keenum even before reporters asked.
sunday, when twice asked directly whether he would consider making a quarterback switch for the week 10 game at the new york jets, he sidestepped a definitive answer.
“we’ll circle the wagons with the coaches and look at the tape,” he said.
“but i’m pleased with the way case has fought.”
the boos rained down in the first quarter after a pass deflection and a sack.
they continued into the second quarter as a rams offense led by quarterback case keenum sputtered.
late in the first half against the carolina panthers, some fans at the coliseum apparently could not take it any longer.
the boos rained down in the first quarter after a pass deflection and a sack.
they continued into the second quarter as a rams offense led by quarterback case keenum sputtered.
late in the first half against the carolina panthers, some fans at the coliseum apparently could not take it any longer.
for seven weeks in a row, their games have been within reach in the fourth quarter.
in the last month of games, they’ve lost to buffalo, detroit, the new york giants and carolina.
the rams defense is holding up its end of the bargain.
that unit yielded 244 yards to the panthers, a week after giving up 232 to the giants.
those type of gold-plated efforts should translate into victories.
not so.
this team was built to win with its defense, and by putting the ball in the hands of running back todd gurley, last season’s offensive rookie of the year.
he ran for 48 yards in 12 carries sunday, falling short of 100 yards for the 14th time in 15 games.
granted, they do not have a good offensive line, but the rams are ultraquick to abandon the run.
only once sunday did they stick the ball in gurley’s gut on consecutive plays, and that was on the second and third snaps of the game.
if goff were at quarterback, the rams would almost certainly lean more on the run than they do now.
if he is who the coaches believe he is, he would also stretch the defense with some down-the-field completions.
the maddening thing about keenum is he has made enough plays to muddy the waters.
even when he had four interceptions in the loss to the giants, at least half of those could be blamed on his receivers.
every time it starts looking crystal clear that goff should start warming up on the sideline, keenum comes through with a key play or big drive.
photos from the rams' 13-10 loss to the carolina panthers
on the rams’ final possession sunday, keenum put together a 15-play scoring drive that culminated with a 10-yard touchdown pass to kenny britt.
that march included a highlight-reel play in which the right-handed keenum, under heavy pressure, instinctively switched the ball to his left hand and completed a pass to benny cunningham.
he even surprised himself with that.
“i’ve never done that before,” he said.
“i don’t know what happened.
… it was an interesting play.”
earlier in the fourth quarter, keenum hit lance kendricks with a seven-yard pass at the goal line, but the ball — albeit rocketed — fell incomplete.
kendricks said he should have made the catch even though the ball “had a lot of mustard on it.” the rams kicked a field goal.
asked about the cheers for goff, keenum shrugged and said, “they have a right to feel however they want to feel.
i’m always the type of person that, i’m glad the fans are there and the stadium is full.
we’re frustrated, too, that we’re not scoring points.”
goff sat at his locker after the game and scrolled through messages on his phone.
he acknowledged hearing the chants but didn’t have anything to say about them.
clearly, he and keenum have forged a friendship, and they had a brief conversation at their side-by-side lockers.
they understand the nature of the business.
“it’s upsetting that we’ve been within a score multiple times and not coming away with a victory,” keenum said.
“i’m never going to let it get me down.
i’ve got tough skin, and i’m going to keep fighting, keep battling.”

2 offense in practice.
“as i say consistently, repeatedly, week after week, i’m pleased with jared’s progress,” fisher said.

it’s time for a change.

mosul, iraq —  the latest on the battle to retake mosul from the islamic state group (all times local):
10:15 p.m.
a u.s. official says the nearly three-week offensive against islamic state extremists in mosul is "ahead of schedule."
brett mcgurk, the white house envoy to the u.s.-led anti-is coalition, spoke sunday to reporters in jordan.
the push to drive is out of mosul, iraq's second largest city, slowed in recent days.
iraqi forces have entered more densely populated areas, where they cannot rely as much on airstrikes and shelling because of the risk posed to civilians.
mcgurk says the campaign to degrade the group and break up its self-declared caliphate in syria and iraq was expected to take about three years.
the envoy says two years into the campaign, "in many ways we are ahead of where we thought we would be."

the spokesman for salahuddin province, ali al-hamdani, says the deadliest was in samarra where a suicide bomber blew himself up among shiite pilgrims after detonating a parked car bomb, killing 11 and wounding up to 100.
iranian pilgrims were among the casualties.
the city, 60 miles (95 kilometers) north of baghdad, is home to a revered shiite shrine.
al-hamdani added that another suicide bomber rammed his explosives-laden car into a check point outside the salahuddin provincial capital, tikrit, killing at least nine people and wounding 25.

iraq's special forces say they are still struggling to clear neighborhoods retaken from the islamic state group along mosul's eastern edge.
lt. col. muhanad al-timimi says sunday that elaborate defenses built by is and the presence of civilians have slowed progress.
the civilians make it more difficult for iraqi commanders on the ground to get requests for u.s.-led coalition air strikes cleared.
iraq's special forces are some of the country's best troops, but they largely rely on air support.
iraqi forces first entered the eastern edge of mosul on tuesday.
on friday, forces began pushing into mosul proper, but so far have only advanced into the city just over a kilometer (mile).
on the city's southern front iraqi forces are still some 20 kilometers from the city center.

gic will buy p3 logistics parks for 2.4 billion euros ($2.7 billion), the singaporean sovereign wealth fund said on monday, in what it said was europe's largest real-estate deal of 2016.
p3, which runs logistics properties across europe, was sold by tpg real estate and ivanhoé cambridge.
with more 163 warehouses across nine countries, p3 has 11 new sites are under construction, with 300,000 square metres of approved development scheduled by year-end.
the transaction is expected to close by the end of 2016, subject to regulatory approval.
"we believe p3's strong growth will continue given its diversified, income-producing portfolio and substantial land bank," lee kok sun, chief investment officer at gic real estate, said in a statement.
"we are confident of the long-term potential of the european logistics sector, and look forward to expanding this attractive platform with the very capable p3 management team."
gic, one of the world's top ten global real estate investment firms, has already inked a number of property deals this year.
in october, the fund teamed up with indonesian firm pt mega manunggal property tbk to spend $720 million on warehouses in southeast asia's largest economy.
and in august it joined two other investors to buy a 71 percent stake in u.s. manufactured housing estate developer yes communities in a deal that valued yes at more than $2 billion, according to the wall street journal.
gic warned in july, however, that its portfolio return slowed in its latest five-year measurement period and that its growth would remain low over the coming decade.
the fund said in its annual report that its portfolio return was 3.7 percent a year in dollar-nominal terms over the five years through march 2016, versus 6.5 percent in the same period to march 2015.
the fund doesn't provide one-year returns, nor disclose the size of its assets under management.

istanbul —  a kurdish militant group has claimed responsibility for a car bomb attack in turkey's southeast, following a claim by the islamic state group for the same attack.
tak, also known as the kurdistan freedom falcons, stated on its website sunday that it conducted the suicide attack in the majority kurdish city of diyarbakir in response to turkey's "relentless oppression and attacks."
tak is an offshoot of the banned kurdistan workers' party or pkk, which turkey considers a terrorist organization.
the friday morning explosion near a riot police building killed at least 11 people, including two police officers.
the diyarbakir governor's office says pkk militants were behind the attack, based on radio intelligence and has dismissed the claim of responsibility by is militants.

rookie quarterback dak prescott threw three touchdown passes and kept any talk for tony romo unnecessary, leading the dallas cowboys to a 35-10 win on sunday over the winless cleveland browns.
rookie ezekiel elliott rushed for 92 yards and scored twice and durable tight end jason witten had 134 yards receiving for the cowboys, off to their best start since 2007.
prescott has won seven straight starts since losing the season opener, and with the cowboys (7-1) leading the nfc east and getting better, there’s no reason for the team to accelerate romo’s return from a back injury.
romo returned to practice earlier this week and is looking at a return at some point this season, but with how prescott is playing, the 36-year-old doesn’t look as if he’ll be back on the field anytime soon.
the miserable browns (0-9) dropped their franchise-record 12th straight game going back to last season and are 3-27 in their past 30.
they also started 0-9 in 1975.
eli manning threw for four touchdowns and new york’s defense had two interceptions and three stops on fourth downs to beat philadelphia 28-23.
the giants (5-3) won their third straight game, holding off the eagles (4-4 after a 3-0 start) after manning was intercepted with less than two minutes to go.
two of manning’s touchdowns went to odell beckham jr, with the others to roger lewis jr. and sterling shepard.
it was a game marked by big plays on offense — six of more than 30 yards in the first half alone— and defense (four interceptions) and special teams (jason pierre-paul’s block of a field goal, darren sproles’ 66-yard punt return).
most of sunday, it was a mismatch of manning and his receiving corps against a sieve of an eagles secondary.
new york picked on every philly defensive back, with the biggest leodis mckelvin, no matter who he tried to cover.
less than two minutes in, landon collins made his third interception in the last two games; he had one pick as a rookie last year.
manning found beckham on a slant after mckelvin failed to bump him at the line, and beckham surged into the end zone for a 26-yard score.
andrew adams, a rookie safety from uconn, had no interceptions in his previous five games.
he sure knew what to do with the ball after hauling in carson wentz’s high pass moments later, returning it 19 yards.
manning hit lewis three plays later after mckelvin and jaylen watkins collided and it was 14-0.
manning’s third td throw came on a one-yard jump ball to beckham over mckelvin to make it 21-10.
wentz looked like a rookie from an fcs school in the first half, often appearing befuddled by coverages.
twice, the eagles failed on short fourth downs while in field goal range.
but he came out of halftime a different player, quickly guiding the eagles 70 yards to kenjon barner’s 3-yard td run.
manning, though, was just as precise and decisive on the ensuing drive, capped by his fourth td throw, 32 yards to rookie shepard.
that gave manning his first four-td game since game 14 last season.
joe flacco threw a 95-yard touchdown pass to mike wallace, and the baltimore ravens frustrated an ineffective ben roethlisberger in a 21-14 victory over the pittsburgh steelers.
baltimore (4-4) snapped a four-game losing streak and moved into a tie atop the afc north with the steelers (4-4), who have dropped three in a row.
three weeks after undergoing surgery on his right knee, roethlisberger returned well ahead of schedule.
playing for the first time since oct. 16, the 13-year veteran looked out of sync until the fourth quarter, when he directed a 75-yard drive that got the steelers to 21-7 with 8:38 remaining.
before that, pittsburgh’s offense produced only two first downs and was limited to 69 yards.
the steelers finished with 36 yards rushing, 32 by le’veon bell.
roethlisberger ran for a 4-yard score with 48 seconds left, but chris boswell botched the onside kick — barely knocking it off the tee — and baltimore ran out the clock.
after going 8 for 18 for 54 yards and an interception through three quarters, roethlisberger closed at 23 for 45 for 264 yards.
matthew stafford threw a 28-yard touchdown pass to golden tate, who vaulted into the end zone in overtime to give the detroit lions a 22-16 victory over the minnesota vikings on sunday.
after matt prater kicked a 58-yard field goal as time expired to force overtime, tate finished the opening drive when he ran through arm tackles by xavier rhodes and harrison smith and leaped in for the winning score.
stafford completed 23 of 36 passes for 219 yards, two touchdowns and an interception for the lions (5-4), who have won four of their past five games.
tate had 11 catches for 79 yards.
sam bradford completed 31 of 40 passes for 273 yards and a touchdown for the vikings (5-3), who started the season 5-0 but have imploded since coming out of the bye.
stefon diggs had a career-high 13 catches for 80 yards.
rookie kenyan drake scored untouched on a 96-yard kickoff return with 5:15 left, and the miami dolphins won a seesaw battle with the new york jets, 27-23.
jay ajayi rushed for 111 yards and helped to run out the clock after the dolphins came from behind for the third time.
a botched dolphins punt led to a touchdown that put new york ahead 23-20.
on the ensuing kickoff , new york’s antonio allen was called for being offside, so the jets had to kick again.
drake took the kickoff, found a lane and sped past the final jet — kicker nick folk — into the clear.
the dolphins (4-4) won their third game in a row, while new york (3-6) fell deeper into last place in the afc east.
the jets hurt themselves with four personal foul penalties, two interceptions thrown by ryan fitzpatrick and numerous missed chances.
ajayi finished 89 yards short in his bid to become the first nfl rusher to have three consecutive 200-yard games.
he still enjoyed a productive day despite being hit behind the line on many of his 24 carries.
ajayi had 55 yards in the fourth quarter.
the kansas city chiefs stuffed the offensively inept jacksonville jaguars on fourth down with less than two minutes left deep in their own territory, preserving a 19-14 victory despite finishing without five offensive starters.
nick foles threw for 187 yards and a first-half touchdown toss to albert wilson, and helped to set up four field goals by cairo santos, as kansas city (6-2) won its 10th consecutive home game.
meanwhile, the jaguars (2-6) couldn’t overcome four turnovers — including a fumble at the goal line in the fourth quarter — in their first game with quarterback coach nathaniel hackett directing the offense.
blake bortles threw for 252 yards and two touchdowns with a pick, showing little improvement after a week spent with his personal coach, adam dedeaux .
his wide receivers hardly helped him, dropping several passes, including an early fourth-down throw that cost jacksonville a chance at points.
chris ivory rumbled for 107 yards in the biggest bright spot for jacksonville, but he fumbled going over the goal-line with 8:28 left in the game.
the jaguars quickly got the ball back, and bortles hit tj yeldon to get within 19-14 with 4:10 to go, but the extra time it took to score proved costly.
they got the ball back with 3:01 remaining, and a long scamper by bortles gave them a chance.
but his pass on fourth-and-3 at the kansas city 32 was batted to the ground and the chiefs ran out the clock.

hong kong — in the nearly two decades since hong kong returned to chinese rule, the communist government in beijing has tolerated all manner of activity in the city that it generally finds intolerable on the mainland: annual vigils for those killed in the tiananmen square massacre, newspapers publishing scurrilous gossip about china’s leaders, huge demonstrations for free elections.
but by deciding to intervene in a local court case and essentially blocking two politicians from taking seats in hong kong’s legislature, china signaled more clearly than ever on monday that there was a limit to its tolerance in this former british colony, which was promised a “high degree of autonomy” in an international treaty.
the two young activists who are testing that limit are advocates of independence for hong kong.
while being sworn in, they made a statement of defiance against chinese rule, using a crude obscenity and a term that many consider a slur against chinese people.
in acting against them, the government of president xi jinping has asserted new authority to set policy in hong kong, opening what could be a more chaotic era here, in which elected officials are held to a vague standard of political loyalty and blacklisted if they fall short.
advertisement
the communist party’s intervention in hong kong’s independent legal system could also damage the territory’s reputation as an international trade and finance hub in asia.
many multinational corporations, banks and law firms are based here because of the dependability and fairness of the city’s courts.
advertisement
businesses also find hong kong appealing because of its political stability, but thousands of people demonstrated and clashed with the police on sunday night in anticipation of beijing’s action, which could incite more street protests.
china’s move came in the form of a rare interpretation of the basic law, the charter that governs hong kong and that was negotiated with britain before the territory’s return to chinese rule in 1997.
the charter gives china’s parliament the right to interpret the basic law, and the communist leadership has done so four other times since the handover.
monday’s ruling breaks new ground because it is the first time that beijing has acted in a pending court case without a request by the hong kong government or judiciary, and because it appears to establish a mechanism for the authorities to block critics of communist rule from taking elected office or even getting their names on ballots.
some scholars said the decision went beyond interpreting the charter and amounted to rewriting the local statute governing how officials are to be sworn in.
it requires lawmakers to read their oaths “completely and solemnly,” exactly as written, and orders those who administer oaths to disqualify lawmakers who alter or deliver the words in an “insincere or undignified manner,” barring them from office without another chance to be sworn in.
the decision also says lawmakers will be held liable if they violate their oaths, but it provides no guidance on who has the power to determine whether a lawmaker is in breach or what the punishment should be.
the fear is that this will inject a degree of arbitrariness into a system that is based on rules underpinned by centuries of precedent under british common law.
“whether it would affect my seat is secondary,” nathan law, 23, a new member of the legislative council who advocates greater self-determination for hong kong, said of the ruling by beijing.
“what’s most important is that the interpretation is vesting so much power in a person to decide whether someone is sincere and allegiant enough to take office, and there is no checks-and-balance against that person.”
the basic law says little about oaths, only that officials must swear allegiance “in accordance with law” to the “hong kong special administrative region of the people’s republic of china.”
two politicians elected to the legislature in september, sixtus leung, 30, known as baggio, and yau wai-ching, 25, set off the legal case by changing the wording of their oaths, replacing the word china with “chee-na,” a term that many find offensive and that was used by japan during world war ii, when it occupied much of china, including hong kong.
ms. yau also inserted an obscenity.
advertisement
the chinese government condemned the pair and labeled them threats to national security for their advocacy of independence, and officials in beijing left little doubt in announcing monday’s decision that it was intended to keep them out of office.
li fei, the chairman of china’s parliamentary committee on the basic law, compared mr. leung and ms. yau, and their supporters, to traitors espousing a “fascist” line.
“there is a great patriotic tradition in the chinese nation,” he said.
“all traitors and those who sell out their countries will come to no good end.”
he added that the government’s stance “will not be ambiguous or lenient.”
the united states, on the eve of its own presidential election, urged china not to undermine the “one country, two systems” formula that has protected basic civil liberties in hong kong.
the united states believes “an open society with the highest possible degree of autonomy and governed by the rule of law is essential for hong kong’s continued stability and prosperity as a special administrative region of the people’s republic of china,” the state department spokesman, mark c. toner, said on monday.
hong kong’s politicians reacted along predictable lines, with the pro-beijing establishment endorsing the decision and the pro-democracy opposition criticizing it as an infringement on self-rule in the territory.
the unpopular chief executive, leung chun-ying, vowed to fully enforce the decision, saying, “this is about the country’s unity and sovereignty.”
michael tien, a pro-beijing lawmaker in hong kong who endorsed the ruling, said it could be used to screen future candidates running for office and to challenge those who have already taken seats in the 70-member legislative council, including several opposition lawmakers who have made statements in favor of self-determination or independence for hong kong.
“this thing is expansive,” mr. tien said in a telephone interview, adding that beijing’s allies in hong kong could ask courts to rule on whether these lawmakers were sincere in swearing allegiance or had violated their oaths.
such a process is likely to be contentious, said simon young, a legal scholar at the university of hong kong, because the language of beijing’s decision is short on specifics.
it says nothing about whether advocating self-determination or independence violates an officeholder’s oath, for example, or how to handle candidates who change their position on the issue.
advertisement
as a result, politicians such as mr. leung and ms. yau could seek to win back their seats by renouncing support for independence and going back to court.
and that could lead beijing to intervene further and issue new decisions to stamp out people it wants to disqualify.
“this will possibly be the first of a possible series of interpretations,” mr. young said.
in the meantime, he added, “the courts in hong kong will have to interpret the interpretation.”
the chinese government’s overarching goal is to crush a small but growing independence movement in hong kong, which gained momentum after beijing rejected calls for free elections in the territory during the enormous pro-democracy demonstrations of 2014.
but by intervening in the legal case over mr. leung and ms. yau, mr. xi has drawn more attention to their cause, and he risks provoking a backlash that could strengthen it.
in a scene that resembled the 2014 demonstrations, the police used pepper spray early monday to battle crowds of protesters who had gathered around the chinese government’s liaison office in hong kong, some of whom were shouting, “hong kong independence.”

greek prime minister alexis tsipras promised "brighter days" on saturday after a cabinet reshuffle aimed at speeding up reforms athens has agreed to implement under its latest international bailout deal and to shore up his government's popularity.
but tsipras signaled he would stick to the fiscal course agreed with the european union and the international monetary fund by keeping finance minister euclid tsakalotos in his post.
greece wants to wrap up a review on labor reforms and fiscal issues swiftly to qualify for more debt relief and for inclusion in the european central bank's bond buying program.
this will help it to regain bond market access by 2018, when its current bailout program expires.
tsipras relying on 'political theater': teneo
wolfango piccoli, co-president at teneo intelligence, says that greek prime minister alexis tsipras' disagreements with financial authorities are unhelpfully "wasting time."
"we have the opportunity for a new start that will give us the necessary impetus for the last critical steps of a marathon leading us to brighter days," tsipras told reporters after his new cabinet was sworn in on saturday.
tsipras switched his ministers around in the rejig late on friday, but brought few new faces to his cabinet.
the conservative opposition new democracy party called the reshuffle a "recycling of the same corrupt faces".
"for greece and its citizens, there are no prospects by this dangerous government," spokesman george koumoutsakos said.
tsipras appointed dimitris liakos, the chief of his economic office and a former fund manager, as the minister responsible for the implementation of greece's bailout program.
to appease the creditors who have accused greece of foot-dragging in selling state assets, tsipras replaced energy minister panos skourletis, who has openly opposed some privatizations, with george stathakis, currently the economy minister.
skourletis was moved to the interior ministry.
shipping minister thodoris dritsas was replaced by panagiotis kouroublis, currently the interior minister.
the shipping ministry oversees the privatization of greek ports.
the head of greece's privatization agency, stergios pitsiorlas, was named deputy minister under dimitris papadimitrou, economist and president of the levy economics institute, who was appointed economy and development minister.
tsipras has been ‘mr teflon’ for 2 years now: pro
joan hoey, regional manager for europe at economist intelligence unit, explains why she believes greece will likely leave the euro zone, when looking at the prospects from its third bailout program.
effie achtsioglou, a 31-year-old labour ministry official who participated in the negotiations with the foreign lenders, was appointed labour minister.
"the prime minister tidied up his cabinet," head of alco polling agency costas panagopoulos said.
"this scheme seems more capable to fulfill the country's international obligations."
tsipras set up stand-alone ministries to handle tourism - the economy's key driver - and the crucial issue of migration, as europe struggles with its worst migrant crisis in decades and thousands are stranded in the cash-strapped country.
migration minister yannis mouzalas kept his post, along with the ministers of foreign affairs, defense and tourism.
greece is expected to return to growth in 2017, an event which tsipras hopes will convince greeks that their sacrifices are paying off.
tsipras' closest aide and adviser nikos pappas - who as state minister oversaw an auction on television licenses that was annulled by a top court, was appointed minister of digital governance and media.
tsipras was first elected in january 2015 promising to end years of austerity, but he reversed course six months later and signed up to a new bailout, greece's third aid program since the country's debt crisis broke out in 2010.
he was re-elected in september last year, but his popularity ratings have been dropping for months and his syriza party has been trailing the conservative new democracy party.

brendan fanning at soldier field
sunday 6 november 2016 16.20 gmt


last modified on sunday 6 november 2016 22.00 gmt
when the close-to-capacity crowd at soldier field were subjected to the caterwauling version of ireland’s call, played with a bit of blarney on a violin, the day seemed to be heading only south.
moments later it was yanked back and pointed upwards, with the ireland players facing the haka by forming a perfect figure of eight in memory of anthony foley.
it was one of the great rescue acts.
and not the last on a remarkable day.
what followed was a classic test match, not for its low error count or non-stop action – there were lots of spills and the whole thing took an age to complete – but for the way it developed into a familiar and gripping theme: underdogs set the pace, and then are visibly running out of energy as they are chased down.
the history of the fixture only heightened the prize.
many all blacks reach for the line that they do not want to be the first ones to lose to ireland.
that will be amended in a fortnight into not wanting to be the first to lose back-to-back in this fixture.
technically there are speed bumps to get out of the way before the teams meet again in dublin on 19 november – new zealand have italy in rome on saturday while ireland take on canada in dublin – but the interim is all about what we will get when we tune in to the rematch.
“it is easy when you win, you give yourself a pat on the back,” said the all blacks coach, steve hansen.
but when you lose you give yourself a wee uppercut because there are things you have got to get better at.
we have to go away and look at where they beat us, how they beat us and how we are going to get better so that in a fortnight’s time we can contest the game.”
it is almost certain that effort will be made without the hugely influential, and now hamstrung, ryan crotty – his departure was felt most when the all blacks were chasing ireland down – and george moala.
on the upside both brodie retallick and sam whitlock are expected to hook up with the squad pre-rome, with retallick the better bet of the two to feature against ireland in dublin.
now they need, literally, an uplift at the lineout.
in a nightmarish first half for new zealand their stats out of touch were just that.
by the break they were 57%, and while they had recovered to 80% at the finish the damage had been done.
ireland’s maul was very good, their tackle completions were first class until falling off a few in the final quarter.
and their discipline was on a different chart to that of the all blacks, conceding only four penalties against new zealand’s 12.
it all contributed to that commanding half-time lead of 25–8.
and when it got out to 30–8 early in the second half, with simon zebo’s try – ireland’s fourth – the kiwis looked badly rattled as they gathered behind their own posts.
brilliant efforts from the replacement tj perenara and ben smith changed the picture into one where ireland would have to score again rather than try to hang on for the final 15 minutes.
and that’s what made this game different.
in 2013 ireland were caught in overtime having led 22-7 at half-time; in 2001 they were 16-7 ahead at the break at lansdowne road, and when denis hickie scored early in the second half the packed house were convinced that game 15 in the series would deliver a win.
imagine if you had told them then it would be game 29 before that bridge would be crossed?
lifting the tempo and getting back into all black territory, for robbie henshaw’s try – a record fifth for ireland in this fixture – not only saved the game but changed the relationship between these two rugby nations.
in that sequence of securing the territory, providing the platform with another perfect scrum, and then having the accuracy to score straight off the set piece, ireland made a statement that had been beyond them in 2013.
for that joe schmidt can take great credit.
the reality is that pre-game in chicago he looked like a coach who wanted to get through the day as quickly as possible, and with limited damage.
schmidt did not believe the preparation time en route to the us would allow his team to be close, never mind win.
but the new zealander has done more than he realises with this group.
now he has a fortnight to fine-tune the stuff that will make his team harder to beat.
that effort will be without jordi murphy, who has a suspected anterior cruciate ligament problem, but both sean o’brien and peter o’mahony got more miles on the road this weekend against zebre and ospreys respectively.
and johnny sexton’s departure at soldier field, which allowed the stellar joey carbery a test debut, was seemingly down to a cramp problem.
the rematch on 19 november has long since sold out.

prime minister says current system is ‘generous enough’ in a move which could hamper delhi trade talks
anushka asthana political editor

theresa may has dashed indian hopes for a more liberal visa system for its nationals wanting to work in the uk by arguing that the current offer is generous enough.
speaking on the way to her first bilateral meeting in delhi, the prime minister argued that britain was already able to attract the “brightest and best” from outside the eu.
“the figures show that we issue more work visas to india than i think us, australia and china put together.
nine out of 10 visa applications from india are already accepted.
we have, i believe, a good system,” she said.
the comments will prove disappointing for some in the indian government and business community who have argued for more of their highly skilled professional workers to be able to get six-month visas for the uk and other european countries.
the demand for more freedoms for indian workers moving abroad was a part of trade negotiations with the eu, which stalled because of failure to agree on it and other issues.
vince cable, the former lib dem business secretary, said may’s refusal to agree to any such liberalisation in the past was a key stumbling block to trade talks between the eu and india.
although he admitted they were complex negotiations, he claimed that her unwillingness to budge was down to an obsession over getting the net migration numbers down as home secretary.
may said she hoped that her three-day visit to india would pave the way for a future trade arrangement after brexit as she sought to break down barriers.
however, she suggested she did not think a more generous visa system was necessary.
“trade is an important part of our relationship with india.
india is the third-biggest investor into the uk – second-biggest creator of private sector jobs in the uk.
and the uk is the biggest g20 investor into india, but there is more we can do,” she said.
may was joined by a delegation of business representatives for a trip during which she attended the india-uk tech summit in delhi with prime minister narendra modi before a bilateral meeting.
modi used a speech to heavily hint that he wanted young people to be more able to travel abroad to study, after stricter rules in britain on how long graduates can stay contributed to a halving of the number of indian students coming to the uk to study over five years.
“education is vital for our students and will define our engagement in a shared future.
we must therefore encourage greater mobility and participation of young people in education and research opportunities,” he said.
may used her speech to the tech summit to insist she wanted an open relationship with india, laying out plans for india to become the first visa country to be put on a registered traveller scheme which helps speed up the experience of visitors in british airports.
“that means for indian nationals who frequently come to the uk – and who fuel growth in both our countries – the entry process will become significantly easier.
fewer forms to fill out, access to eu/eea passport control, swifter passage through our airports,” she said.
despite the reluctance to increase migration numbers from india to the uk, the prime minister delivered a passionate argument for free trade between the two countries arguing that it “creates a rising tide that lifts all boats”.
she said britain was determined not to turn its back on the world, adding: “because we know from history what happens when countries do not embrace the opportunities of the world; they stagnate, they get poorer, they don’t protect their people, they make them worse off.”
adding that while countries like india did not owe britain a living, she said working together meant the greatest chance of success.
may also said she did not need to wait to leave the eu to start discussions on how trade and investment could be boosted between the countries.
however, she had earlier made clear she was aware of sentiment in the uk about immigration, and her promise to stick to an ambition of reducing the net migration figure to the tens of thousands would require cutting the numbers from all over the world.
the response could disappoint those of indian origin in the uk and those with links to other commonwealth countries, after brexit campaigners suggested they would benefit from an immigration system that no longer discriminated in favour of europeans.
out campaigner and president of the bangladesh caterers association, pasha khandaker, said he was “very disappointed” by the government saying it is ruling out an australian-style points-based system as promised by vote leave during the referendum campaign.
may has attempted to deflect any row with an offer to make india the first visa country to be added to the registered traveller scheme, under which business travellers can clear border control more quickly in british airports.
it will allow passengers to come through the e-passport gates, usually reserved for britons and europeans, and without a requirement to complete a landing card.
only nine other countries currently benefit from the scheme, including the us, but they are not places where travellers need visas.
the government will also offer a group of high net-worth indians access to a bespoke visa and immigration service called the great club.
that doesn’t offer any guarantees but means individuals – and their immediate family members – are provided with a personal account manager to help them secure visas more quickly and smoothly.
however, the offer falls short of a pilot set up by the prime minister during a recent trip to china for a g20 meeting that cut the price of two-year tourist visas from £330 to £87.
ahead of this trip, chandrajit banerjee, the director of the confederation of indian industry, told the financial times that he was “very, very hopeful” that the prime minister would offer a similar liberalisation to indian visitors.
it followed a letter from senior executives including the heads of heathrow airport and virgin atlantic calling on the government to cut the cost of tourist visas for india – saying that 400,000 indians visited britain last year spending £433m.
however, they warned that france had become a more popular destination.
may is likely to address this issue during her talks but a source played down the issue, stressing that the chinese price cut is a pilot scheme.
the registered travellers scheme will initially be offered to indians travelling on a work visa, with the possibility of rolling it out to other routes in the future.
the government estimates that up to 10,000 indians could benefit from it within the first two years.

veteran paceman peter siddle says he is not concerned about his recent pace drop, claiming he just needs more miles under his belt in order to be able to maintain his speed for longer.
siddle’s pace gradually slowed during the first test at the waca ground.
after starting off in the mid 130s, he faded to the high 120s as the match wore on.
the drop was most noticeable when the temperature hit 37 degrees on saturday.
selectors will stick with the same 12-man squad for the second test in hobart but siddle could be edged out by joe mennie in the final xi.
mennie is no pace ace himself but given siddle bowled for four consecutive days in perth plus only recently returned from a stress fracture in his back and ankle surgery, selectors may opt for the fresher and more match-hardened mennie.
siddle concedes he is still not back to peak fitness following his lengthy layoff.
“i probably haven’t played as much as i would have liked but i felt good,” siddle said after day four, with australia struggling at 169-4 in pursuit of 539 for victory.
“it was a bit tiring to be out there but that’s part of the game.
“when i’m feeling fully fit and have got some miles in the legs, that will all come together.
it’s just about finding some rhythm and that will get there.”
siddle bowled a total of 38 overs during the first test, returning 1-36 and 2-62.
the 31-year-old admitted he was a tad “stiff and sore” as he headed to lunch on day four.
mennie has played two odis for australia but is yet to make his test debut.
the 27-year-old impressed at training in the lead-up to the first test and returned 2-16 and 1-55 for south australia in their crushing sheffield shield win over tasmania in adelaide.
mennie was the leading shield wicket-taker last summer with 51 scalps at 21 and selectors are keen to see how he’ll fare.

the walking dead

“i must break you.”
i didn’t think i’d spend most of the new season of “the walking dead” thinking about “rocky iv,” but here we are.
on sunday we got another extended seminar in the art of prisoner breaking, savior style.
this time it was daryl’s turn, and unlike the zombie fighting, ax fetching and son threatening rick faced, daryl’s program involved a steady diet of dog food sandwiches, terribly cheery pop songs and the occasional beating.
despite all of that and his emotional agony about provoking glenn’s murder, daryl was not willing to subjugate himself to the saviors.
which is to say, we learned he was tough.
of course, we already knew that.
the creators of “the walking dead” often talk about wanting to put the audience inside the show — they used it to defend the glenn dumpster shenanigans, the victim-vision gimmickry of the negan cliffhanger, the appalling violence in the season premiere.
after that one, scott m. gimple, the showrunner, spoke on “the talking dead” about “looking for a way to break the audience” so they would believe rick would do negan’s bidding.
while daryl stayed strong on sunday, the show definitely broke me with all the dog food and sound torture, though perhaps not in the way it intended.
if you put us through a wringer without showing us anything revelatory about the character in question, it just gets annoying and worse: boring.
so allow me to say “i’m negan,” or whomever i need to be in order to avoid more “breaking” episodes.
sunday’s hour was broadly intended to introduce us to life in the sanctuary, the savior stronghold with a general atmosphere signaled by the title of the montage song: “town called malice” by the jam.
we saw dwight, the former savior escapee turned conflicted iron-faced cuckold, enjoying a spoils sandwich as negan’s other minions drank and fought.

the ballad of dwight was the other main thread of the evening.
you’ll recall that we — along with daryl — met him, sherry and tina last season during their flight from negan, with tina’s insulin in tow.
tina met her end when she flopped onto a pair of walkers.
after evading a savior search party, with daryl’s help, dwight and his wife, sherry, betrayed him, taking his motorcycle and precious crossbow.
on sunday negan filled in the blanks, explaining to daryl, at great length, that the couple eventually returned to the sanctuary and were punished for their crimes: negan took dwight’s wife for himself and fried his face for good measure, cowing him into productive subordination.
“now look at him,” negan told daryl.
“one of my top guys, and we are totally cool.”
that’s what he thinks, maybe.
we already knew that dwight wasn’t thrilled by the trappings of the sanctuary because he said as much last year.
“people will do anything for safety,” he told daryl the first time he met him.
we now know what “anything” entails — lots of kneeling, bullying and being bullied, and, for the most luckless residents, tending or serving on the colony’s wall of walkers.
dwight didn’t look any happier about any of that on sunday, spending most of the episode emotionally ambiguous at best.
sent to recover another escapee, he offers a halfhearted might-makes-right defense of the saviors — “we were losing; now we’re not” — before shooting the man in the back.
and his hostility toward daryl came across as a combination of quasi-concern and projected self-loathing, daryl’s inner strength a rebuke to the moral compromises dwight made for his sandwich privileges.
“i ain’t never gonna kneel,” daryl said.
“yeah i said that, too,” dwight said.
by the end, daryl gave dwight a pass for his choices.
but could a day be coming when the iron-faced one borrows some of daryl’s strength and makes a move?
• for the record, that unnervingly upbeat tune of torture was a previously unreleased song called “easy street.” (you may know the vocalist, petra haden, from bands like that dog or the decemberists.)
it’s now available on itunes, in case you hate your neighbors.
• remember the polaroid we saw a savior taking at the end of the premiere?
so does daryl, now that dwight has given it to him.
playing “crying” in that scene was a bit on the nose, as they say, though it feels churlish to note it.
i didn’t love this episode, but norman reedus gave a moving performance throughout.
• as zombie attacks go, i enjoyed the walkers-tumbling-off-the-overpass bit.
• that said, are we supposed to think the motorcycle just falling over caused all that damage?
and what are we to make of the shooting?
was it a mercy killing?
or did dwight shoot the escapee in the back in order to preserve him for the wall?
it wasn’t clear to me.
• what did you think?
what’s next for daryl?
will he and dwight team up?
which song, played incessantly, would break you?
(this is mine.)

kevin mitchell in paris

andy murray’s gift to tennis goes beyond the excellence he brings to the court and the occasional bon mot, intentional or otherwise, with which he embroiders his many triumphs.
in celebrating his capture of the one crown that many doubters thought was beyond his reach, the no1 world ranking novak djokovic held for 122 weeks until this weekend, he reminded us again of his ability to inspire admiration and respect from both his rivals and those close to him.
even the man he beat in the paris masters final here on sunday, john isner, acknowledged the scot is a cut above in every way.
“he’s the guy that everyone is looking up to right now,” the american said after murray had ground out a tenacious 6-3, 6-7 (4-7), 6-4 win over two hours and 17 minutes on court central.
isner added: “and he’s been at the top of the game for so long.
whether it’s no2, 3 or 4 in the world, everyone knows how hard he works and how dedicated he is.
he’s a big inspiration to myself, and i’m sure he’s a big inspiration to other players as well.”
it was a predictably perverse coronation: a three-set fight against an opponent he had beaten seven times in a row and who had broken him just once in 34 attempts.
it is almost a given that a big match involving murray will not be dull.
it has been that way since he stepped on to the grass at wimbledon as a shy and thin teenager 11 years ago.
it was like that when he won the second of his three slams, beating djokovic at wimbledon on a suitably sunny sunday afternoon in 2013 with a hand trembling like a kid’s on his first day at school.
it was probably like that when he first held a racket in dunblane at the age of four.
and so it proved in front of 14,000 enthralled fans here.
murray was nervous, he conceded, but in a good way.
it meant it mattered.
it nearly always does.
isner played near to his best, and said: “my game is the best it’s been all year, without a doubt.
i knew i had to bring it today if i wanted any chance, because not often do you get to a stage in a tournament like this against a guy like that where he plays poorly or gives you the match.”
murray revealed he had never received so many messages of congratulations.
they included tweets from roger federer and rafael nadal among fellow players, the actor kevin spacey, his former coach amélie mauresmo, and echo and the bunnymen.
djokovic, whom murray has known since they were 11, was not among them, although he praised him lavishly after his own exit on friday.
djokovic is still the biggest threat in the game, whatever his problems on and off the court in recent months.
and he may yet regain his place before the year is over.
“when you hear from any players, it’s very nice,” murray said, “because you know you have won their respect.
it is the most important thing when you’re done playing.
i got a lot of messages last night, more than i’ve had after any match i have played in my life, probably.
but the stuff from the family is nicest, because they have been there pretty much from the start.
also, because you’re open with your family, they have seen all the ups and downs and the tough moments you have been through.
it means the most when it comes from the family or people you care about the most.”
if djokovic goes through the atp world tour finals in london next week undefeated he will end the season where he started 2015 and this year, at the top of the pile.
but will he be there?
there were signs of spiritual weariness just short of resignation about his tennis and his demeanour the past few days.
he needs a hug – from his family probably more than his recently acknowledged life coach, pepe imaz, who is said to send him messages through a container of boiled rice.
although he would be reluctant to let the atp down in london by withdrawing (he also has a lingering injury to his right arm), he might take the opportunity to rest properly before the australian open, which starts on 16 january.
that is what federer decided to do when he realised his knee injury was not responding during an even longer sabbatical; likewise, nadal left the battlefield early this year.
but the 29-year‑old murray is still standing – and the oldest to become no1 for the first time since the 30-year-old john newcombe in 1974.
if djokovic were to join federer and nadal on the absentees list, it would be a different sort of triumph for murray: one of endurance, a quality he has always valued.
he said after milos raonic’s pre‑match retirement with a quad injury on saturday that getting to the top of the mountain has always been about lasting the whole season.
djokovic had been there since july, 2014.
he looked almost relieved to be spared the burden of being hunted every week.
pointedly, he did not feel that way in 2011 when racking up 43 wins in a row and during his subsequent periods of dominance.
now, though, he is older and possibly less enthused by the challenge.
as he said after losing to cilic in the quarter-finals: “it took a lot out of me.
it has put some things in perspective and raised some questions in which direction i want to go to.”
his most telling comment was: “in important moments, i wasn’t able to deliver.” in those moments this week, and for the past 19 matches encompassing four titles in a row, that is exactly what murray has been able to do, however tired.
sunday was no different.
isner went in to the match with his strong right arm oiled to perfection, after racking up 88 aces during the week.
he has also returned serve well to get to the final, especially on saturday when he hit a level of consistency that was too strong for cilic.
the quarter-final was cilic’s first win over the serb in 15 attempts, the semi-final was isner’s first win over cilic in seven attempts.
so preconceptions have been tumbling all over the place in paris.
from the start, murray imposed his will on isner and it took only 20 minutes of quality pressure to break him.
two belting forehands earned isner his 35th career break chance against murray – and the scot lobbed the 6ft 10in isner with such delicacy to rescue the situation that the ball would not have smashed had it been a peach.
he survived the minor crisis and went on to take the set in 35 minutes.
there wasn’t much in it but murray was stronger in the big points.
murray soaked up six aces in the first set and they kept coming at him in the second.
isner grabbed four break points in the eighth game but, true to script, could not convert, his last shot drifting long as wearily as a feather on the wind.
isner dug in.
he hit harder, ran faster and moved with increasing menace at the net to force a ninth career tiebreak between them, and found a closing forehand of perfect angle and weight to force a third set.
murray steeled himself to the task with increased vigour, ignoring five aces and a torrent of pace and power oozing from his opponent’s racket.
as we suspected he might, murray outlasted isner again.
it is the refusal to let his level drop for any length of time that has elevated him to where he is – statistically and deservedly the best player in the world right now and, who knows, maybe for a little while to come yet.
pace of advance slows as iraqi forces push into city’s more heavily populated areas
associated press in mosul
sunday 6 november 2016 12.16 gmt


last modified on sunday 6 november 2016 14.10 gmt
iraq’s special forces have been working to fully clear neighbourhoods on mosul’s eastern edge of islamic state militants as suspected isis bombings killed at least 20 people elsewhere around the country.
the current phase and slower pace highlight the challenges ahead for iraqi forces as they press into more populated areas deeper inside mosul – where the civilian presence means they will not be able to rely as much on airstrikes.
“there are a lot of civilians and we are trying to protect them,” said lt col muhanad al-timimi.
“this is one of the hardest battles that we have faced till now.”
some civilians are fleeing the combat zone, while isis militants are holding others back for use as human shields, making it harder for iraqi commanders on the ground to get approval for requests for us-led coalition airstrikes.
iraq’s special forces are some of the country’s best troops, but they still largely rely on air support to clear terrain.
iraqi forces first entered the eastern edge of the city on tuesday.
on friday, forces began pushing into mosul proper, but so far have only advanced just over a mile into the city.
on the city’s southern front iraqi forces are still around 12 miles from the city centre.
the extremists captured the city in 2014, and have had plenty of time to erect fortifications.
trenches and berms have turned the streets and alleyways of a neighbourhood once named after the former iraqi leader saddam hussein into a maze, and concrete blast walls have blocked off access to other areas.
“daesh dug trenches that they filled with water and they have a lot of suicide attackers and car bombs,” said timimi, using the arabic acronym for isis.
isis fought back on saturday, pushing the special forces from the southern edge of the gogjali neighbourhood, where the troops had made their first major foray into the city itself after more than two weeks of fighting in its rural outskirts.
both sides fired mortar rounds and automatic weapons, while the iraqi troops also responded with artillery.
snipers duelled from rooftops in residential areas, where most buildings are just two storeys high.
meanwhile, suspected isis militants struck far from the frontlines with a pair of bombings that killed at least 20 people.
one suicide attack against shia pilgrims north of baghdad killed at least 11 people.
the spokesman for salahuddin province, ali al-hamdani, said the deadliest attack had taken place in the city of samarra, 60 miles north of baghdad, where a revered shia shrine is located.
hamdani said the bomber had parked an ambulance laden with explosives in a car park, and walked up to pilgrims who had just left their buses and were heading to the shrine about 500 metres away.
he detonated explosives in the vehicle and then blew himself up.
hamdani said at least four iranians were among the dead.
up to 100 others were wounded, he said.
during rush hour on sunday morning, another suicide attacker rammed an explosives-laden car into a checkpoint outside salahuddin’s provincial capital, tikrit, killing at least nine people.
hamdani said five female students, a woman and three policemen were killed in the attack, while 25 others were wounded.
no group has claimed responsibility for the attacks, but they bore the hallmarks of isis, which has conducted and claimed dozens of similar bombings.
'there is a flight to safety within shipping industry'
customers are being especially careful when selecting shipping lines amid fears of more supply chain disruptions following the hanjin crisis, says maersk line's robbert van trooijen.
for some global shippers, the bankruptcy of south korea's hanjin  was both a fillip and a sharp reminder of just how much clean-up was needed in their businesses.
maersk, the world's largest shipping company, which shares customers with hanjin, told cnbc on monday how it dealt with the multi-billion dollar crisis.
"right after the bankruptcy was announced, the phone started ringing and people asked us for help.
they (customers) had cargo on the water and didn't want to miss the seasons in the u.s. and europe so we helped them," asia pacific ceo robbert van trooijen told "squawk box."
"but gloating is not the right term here."
an estimated $14 billion worth of cargo was stranded at sea after hanjin shipping, the world's seventh-biggest container line, filed for court receivership on august 31, shocking the logistics industry.
the company's asia-u.s. route is on for sale as part of insolvency proceedings, with the bidding deadline extended on monday to november 10, according to a dow jones report.
following the company's receivership, clients such as lg electronics canceled orders with hanjin and sought emergency alternatives to ship their freight, reuters reported at the time.
so how did maersk help?
"we put replacement tonnage on the berth to make sure the cargo that was supposed to replace the orders that never reached the store are being processed and delivered on time," van trooijen explained.
"the industry hasn't seen a bankruptcy for some time so many people had to look up in the book again what it means when a shipping line goes bankrupt."
in the aftermath of hanjin, there was a flight to safety, he noted, explaining that customers now looked closely at the fundamentals of shipping lines before deciding on service providers.
"when you have cargo stuck on a ship for months because a company went bankrupt, that's a big risk to the supply chain industry."
incidents including hanjin's receivership sparked a welcome wave of consolidation in a sector grappling with overcapacity and slow global trade.
"since the time i've been in the industry, which is 25 years, i've never seen as much consolidation as we've seen in last two years...it's finally taking place in a serious way," van trooijen said.

the rams fell to the panthers, 13-10, for their fourth consecutive loss.
is it time for jeff fisher to insert jared goff at quarterback?
the rams fell to the panthers, 13-10, for their fourth consecutive loss.
is it time for jeff fisher to insert jared goff at quarterback?
the boos rained down in the first quarter after a pass deflection and a sack.
they continued into the second quarter as a rams offense led by quarterback case keenum sputtered.
late in the first half against the carolina panthers, some fans at the coliseum apparently could not take it any longer.
“we want goff!” they chanted.
“we want goff!”
jared goff, the no.
1 pick in the nfl draft, never got off the sideline, but the rams’ 13-10 loss might have served as a referendum for a team that continues to spiral downward, mainly because of an offense that consistently falls short.
the rams’ fourth consecutive loss dropped their record to 3-5.
in each game during the losing streak, they had opportunities to tie or win  with second-half rallies and failed.
“we have to figure out a way to score some points,” coach jeff fisher said.
and run the ball.
and reduce penalties.
on sunday, panthers quarterback cam newton managed to pass for his team’s only touchdown, but that was enough against a rams team  whose offense ranks among the nfl’s worst.
they rams have reached the season’s midpoint, and they are one game into a four-game stretch against opponents that had been struggling.
but the prospects of returning to their early season winning ways are not encouraging.
offensive lineman rodger saffold declared that “enough is enough” and that the offense must score touchdowns.
“enough with just sitting around saying, ‘let’s stick together,’” he said.
“it’s time to just go power it in.”
photos from the rams' 13-10 loss to the carolina panthers
after the rams’ loss to the new york giants in london two weeks ago — a defeat that included four keenum interceptions — fisher did not wait for questions from reporters.
he said keenum would remain the starter.
asked if he would reevaluate that decision after sunday’s performance, fisher said, “i don’t think case’s play [sunday] was indicative of raising the question.”
keenum passed for 296 yards and a late touchdown, but  he missed open receiver brian quick on a deep route and threw short on passes to others.
and with the rams trailing by seven points late in the third quarter, linebacker thomas davis intercepted a keenum pass, bringing on another onslaught of boos.
it was keenum’s 11th interception, and  fifth in two games.
“it was a bad decision,” he said.
“it was a poor decision.”
keenum heard the boos.
“i can tell they’re frustrated,” he said.
the faded coliseum stands were filled with empty seats.
the makeshift coliseum field was filled with empty promises.
the rams reached the halfway point of their homecoming season sunday amid a stadium of boos and a city of yawns.

the rams reached the halfway point of their homecoming season sunday amid a stadium of boos and a city of yawns.
after a dreadful 13-10 defeat by the carolina panthers, it is clear...
and the chants for goff.
“they have a right to feel however they want to feel,” keenum said, adding “we have to score more points, so i understand.”
keenum was not entirely at fault for the rams’ lack of production.
running back todd gurley continued to struggle, gaining only 48 yards in 12 carries.
gurley acknowledged hearing boos.
the loss “was not the end of the world,” he said.
“we’ve been playing the game for a long time,” he said.
“all of us have been booed before, so you’ve just got to ignore it.”
gurley said he supported keenum.
“a lot of people want to put the blame on him and, you know, he’s used to that — that’s what quarterbacks do,” gurley said, adding, “we’re with him and support him and we’re going to keep riding with him.”
keenum did engineer a late threat.
trailing 10-0 midway through the fourth quarter, he drove the rams to the seven-yard line.
but tight end lance kendricks dropped a pass at the goal line, forcing the rams to settle for a field goal.
the panthers added a field goal with 3:18 left before keenum’s short touchdown pass to kenny britt with 34 seconds remaining cut the deficit to three points.
“it was too little, too late,” keenum said.
the rams' dropped to 3-5 after losing to the panthers, 13-10.
they've lost four in a row, so why isn't jared goff, their top pick in the nfl draft, playing?
the rams' dropped to 3-5 after losing to the panthers, 13-10.
they've lost four in a row, so why isn't jared goff, their top pick in the nfl draft, playing?
the panthers recovered a squib kick to secure the victory.
the loss ruined another outstanding effort from a defense that entered the game ranked 11th in the nfl.
a week after newton complained to the nfl commissioner about alleged illegal hits in the pocket, the rams sacked the reigning most valuable player five times.
defensive players would not blame the offense — ranked 30th before sunday — for the rams’ struggles.
“we’ve got to finish games and create turnovers on defense,” said cornerback trumaine johnson, who returned from a knee injury and started.
“i’m not going to point fingers.”
the rams travel to new york next week to play the jets and then play the miami dolphins at home before a thanksgiving weekend game at new orleans.
they have eight games left in a season that is on the verge of going completely awry.
defensive end robert quinn said it was on the players to turn it around.
“hopefully,” he said, “guys are aware of our situation.”

politicians taking office in hong kong's legislative council (legco) must swear allegiance to the city as part of china, the mainland's parliament declared on monday—a ruling likely to further inflame the territory's tense political atmosphere and aggravate anti-beijing sentiment.
"certainly, we can expect more protests to come," said linda li, a professor at city university of hong kong, told cnbc.
ahead of the news, as many as 11,000 demonstrators took to hong kong streets on sunday to protest beijing's involvement in a legal matter concerning two legco lawmakers who insulted china during their swearing-in ceremony.
chaos rapidly ensued, with people using umbrellas as protection from police pepper spray in scenes reminiscent of the city's 2014 pro-democracy umbrella movement.
david wong, deputy at the national people's congress (npc), which is effectively china's parliament, also expected more demonstrations.
"we can anticipate strong reaction.
a small minority of hong kong's population remain adamant on this issue so i wouldn't be surprised if they took to the streets again," he told cnbc's "squawk box."
on october 12, sixtus leung chung-hang, 30, and yau wai-ching, 25, pledged allegiance to "the hong kong nation" and held a banner saying "hong kong is not china" during their oaths, ignoring the original wording.
in retaliation, the city's beijing-backed chief executive c.y.
leung requested the courts oust the duo from legco, and a judicial review began on thursday to decide whether the pair can retake the oaths.
but the mainland also began a meeting on thursday to discuss their matter and its decision on monday, which banned leung and yao from office, will now override the local court.
cy leung said on monday that his government would "fully implement" china's interpretation of the basic law, which sets out china's policies related to hong kong.
the interpretation, beijing's most significant form of legal intervention since hong kong's sovereignty was transferred from the u.k. to china in 1997, would defend national unity and sovereignty, deputy secretary general of the npc standing committee li fei said in a monday press conference.
the npc's wong defended china's actions, saying he did not see the interpretation as beijing pre-empting the hong kong courts.
'beijing has the right to interpret hk's basic law'
david wong from china's national people's congress explains why beijing's ruling on a hong kong legal case is not a 'complicated matter.'
"when we talk about hong kong independence, that's not a local issue, it's a national issue concerning territorial integrity so beijing has a natural role in all of this," he argued.
"to do this interpretation, its within the confines of basic law as well."
a total of five lawmakers had their original oaths invalidated last month but three of them have since retaken their pledges and were officially sworn-in, and are expected to be exempt from monday's decision.
top mainland official zhang xiaoming said on sunday that "it could be complicated to disqualify lawmakers who had finished their oaths," according to the south china morning post.
yau wai-ching and baggio leung will now be forced from office and by-elections will be called, chong ja ian, assistant professor at national university of singapore, explained.
"more direct chinese involvement into hong kong has been a trend; this is likely to increase tensions as many find this kind of chinese role in hong kong hard to accept," he said.
the big question on everyone's mind was whether monday's decision would set a precedent for more chinese interference in the sar's legal system.
li fei said on monday that beijing policymakers would "only interpret the basic law on important issues, but not on hong kong's internal affairs".
he also noted that that the central government would not be "obscure or lenient" in quashing acts that promoted hong kong independence.
however, that all depended on the actions of hong kongers, experts said.
"it really depends whether the city's situation continues to deteriorate.
if it does, the central government will see that it has no other means except to intervene.
but that's the worst-case scenario, beijing doesn't want to do that as its not in china's best interest to let the situation worsen,' explained professor li.

concerns over a trump presidency are set to dominate the early days of global climate talks in morocco.
some 20,000 participants are meeting in marrakech for two weeks, starting on monday, to agree new rules to limit warming on the planet.
these plans were boosted when the paris climate agreement came into force last week.
however mr trump, who calls climate change a "hoax", has vowed to cancel the deal if elected.
signed by 193 countries in the french capital last december, the paris agreement is now international law, having been ratified by at least 55 countries representing over 55% of global emissions.
the un deal, hammered out after years of failed talks, aims to keep the rise in global temperatures under 2 degrees celsius by the end of this century, and "will pursue efforts" to limit the rise to 1.5c.
when countries put forward their own plans, or intended nationally determined contributions (indcs) on what they will do to cut emissions and transition to renewables, much of the detail about how to verify these plans was left vague.
this will be one of the tasks that negotiators from all over the world will face in marrakech at the conference of the parties (cop22) over the next two weeks.
but the early days of the talks will be dominated by the prospect of donald trump gaining the white house.
earlier this year mr trump said he would "cancel" the paris agreement if elected.
the deal was "bad for us business" and would allow "foreign bureaucrats control over how much energy we use", he said.
concern over the rise of mr trump helped galvanise the global push to bring the paris agreement into force.
now that it is operational and binding on countries, taking the us out of the deal would not be easy.
"the paris agreement prohibits any exit for a period of three years, plus a year-long notice period, so there will be four stable years," said segolene royal, the french environment minister who played a role in negotiating the treaty.
while mr trump would not be able to withdraw easily from paris, his scepticism about climate science and his determination to revive the coal industry put him at odds with most international leaders.
"electing a climate science conspiracy theorist like trump would make america a global laughing stock and embarrassment, all the while relinquishing our leadership role in the world," said khalid potts from us environmental group, the sierra club.
"the ice caps don't negotiate, and neither do rising seas.
donald trump's moral failure to acknowledge the climate crisis might very well mean planetary disaster if he is elected."
while negotiators await the outcome of the us election, there are several other factors that might also slow progress in these talks.
one key element that might hold things up is the fact that so far only 100 have ratified the paris agreement.
there is a concern that it would be unfair if these early adopters had the chance to set the future rules under which all countries would have to operate.
"the momentum of the entry into force will help to push for progress in discussing the overall implementation process," dennis taenzler from adelphi, a climate change think tank, told bbc news.
"there is some reason to expect that key decisions will be postponed until additional parties will have ratified as well."
another big question for the marrakech meeting is whether countries will see it as an opportunity to push for greater action and go further than they did in paris.
in recent days, an analysis from the un environment programme suggested that the national plans on the table will need to have their level of ambition increased by about 25% if the paris targets are to be met.
there are some positive signs.
last month at a meeting in rwanda, countries agreed to phase out the use of hfcs, gases with significant global warming potential.
international aviation has taken the first, limited steps to put in place a global limit on aircraft emissions.
in recent days china has announced a plan to tighten the level of carbon emissions per unit of gdp.
"there are actually some remarkable things going on, even in north america, with canada introducing a carbon tax.
canada, us and mexico had a remarkable tri-party agreement on methane for example," said andrew steer from the world resources institute.
"you've got a surprising number of countries around the world that are putting in place carbon pricing - something like 40 countries have committed to do that.
already there are 200 million chinese under a price on carbon, and by this time next year we hope there will be 1.1 billion chinese under a price on carbon."
the marrakech meeting will also see significant debate about the format for a future "global stock take" - a five yearly review of progress that countries have made against the targets that they have signed up to.
it is a key part of the paris agreement, designed to ratchet up ambition over time.
there will also be reviews on finance to see if richer countries have made progress on the promise to deliver $100bn in climate aid to developing nations by 2020.
one issue that could see sparks fly is the question of loss and damage.
the question of compensation for the long term impacts of climate change is one of the most contentious as poor countries see it as a moral obligation of the rich, while the developed world is extremely wary of establishing a legal liability for the damage caused by their greenhouse gas emissions.
it has been lurking on the sidelines since it almost derailed the entire un talks process back in 2013.
it will be interesting to see if it causes similar rancour in marrakech.

italian’s switch to 3-4-3 formation has inspired a revival that has made chelsea look like title contenders and to which everton had no answer
jacob steinberg at stamford bridge

not that antonio conte felt anything other than disgust when chelsea imploded at arsenal at the end of september, but there are times when a heavy defeat can help a manager eradicate his team’s problems.
conte was under pressure after that humiliation in north london and it was difficult to see what had changed since the italian’s arrival in the summer.
chelsea still looked as old, slow, directionless and defensively vulnerable as they had at the end of josé mourinho’s second spell in charge and no one inside or outside stamford bridge viewed them as title contenders.
they had also been outplayed by liverpool at stamford bridge and the focus was on whether chelsea had given conte enough backing in the transfer window.
but instead of throwing a tantrum, the former italy and juventus manager kept his cool, backed his ability to work with the tools at his disposal and made the proactive decision to introduce his favoured 3-4-3 system.
a new chelsea have emerged.
the defensive solidity of old has returned, they press feverishly out of possession and know that they can rely on eden hazard and diego costa to inspire them up front.
a mood of despondency has given way to boundless optimism after a run of five consecutive victories and clean sheets, with everton the latest side to feel the full force of what has been a stunning resurgence.
everton were begging for mercy by the time pedro made it 5-0 in the 65th minute and confirmation that chelsea can be major players in this title race meant that conte could reflect on that fretful period after the defeat at arsenal as a turning point.
“i was worried because we conceded a lot of goals in every game and conceded many chances and for this reason we changed it,” he said.
“usually when you lose, it’s important to have a good idea and to change to improve and to explain why you had this defeat.
then i think together with the players we are working very hard and finding a new way to change the situation.”
searching for a way to counter chelsea’s system, ronald koeman mimicked them from the start.
but everton were 2-0 down after 20 minutes and koeman was forced into making a change.
it made no difference.
koeman said that he had never seen a side look so strong in a 3-4-3 and the only surprise is that chelsea did not start the season in that formation.
“in my mind i wanted to play with a 4-2-4,” conte said.
“i wanted to start this way because when you have strong wingers, i like to play with two strikers very close.
but then i changed.
during pre-season, there was 4-2-4 and 3-4-3 because this squad could play these systems.
i changed it to find more balance defensively and in offensive situations.”
koeman said that conte has given his players a winning mentality and that improved mindset can be seen in hazard’s transformation.
despite dominating the individual awards in the 2014-15 campaign, the belgian’s relationship with mourinho deteriorated last season and he scored only four league goals.
conte has brought the best out of him, however, and hazard’s superb double against everton took his tally to seven goals from his first 11 league matches.
dizzying everton’s defence with the speed of his dribbling and movement, he also played key roles in the goals for costa, marcos alonso and pedro.
whether chelsea are good enough to win the league will probably depend on hazard maintaining this form.
perhaps the biggest success for conte, though, is how he has chosen to work with players who were written off in the past.
after disappointing in his debut season, pedro is showing why he was such an important player for barcelona.
victor moses was energetic on the right, nemanja matic played with authority in central midfield and david luiz was calm and elegant in defence, marking romelu lukaku out of the game.
“we worked a lot to change the situation,” conte said.
“last season was very bad for all the players and it was very important to increase the confidence.
players like moses, alonso and pedro, they are playing in a fantastic way.
i hope they continue to improve.”

beijing has made an unprecedented intervention in hong kong politics to block two lawmakers from taking office.
pro-independence elected lawmakers sixtus leung and yau wai-ching have refused to pledge allegiance to beijing when being sworn in.
beijing has now interpreted a section of hong kong law to mean any official who does not swear the oath properly cannot take office, said state media.
the move comes after weeks of chaos in the hong kong legislature.
there were also protests, and some scuffles, in hong kong on sunday night, with at least four arrests.
hong kong's chief executive cy leung said his government would "fully implement" the ruling.
hong kong is semi-autonomous under the "one country, two systems" framework in place since it was returned to china in 1997.
but its mini constitution, the basic law, states beijing still has the final say in how to interpret its laws.
for hong kong's democracy movement, china's intervention is a challenge to freedom of expression and judicial independence, but for beijing the bigger picture is paramount.
all talk of independence is seen as threatening and elsewhere in china, separatism is a crime and campaigning for independence results in a lengthy jail term.
to allow elected members of hong kong's legislature to use such a high-profile public platform to insult china and talk of a hong kong nation was unthinkable.
hong kong's courts do still uphold the freedoms promised when britain handed the territory back to china nearly two decades ago.
but this intervention from beijing is a reminder that china is determined to decide the limits of those freedoms.
the question for hong kong's young democracy activists now is where to take their defiance next.
the interpretation by beijing's rubber-stamp parliament, the national people's congress (npc), marks beijing's most far-reaching intervention in hong kong since the handover.
mr leung and ms yau belong to the youngspiration party, which sprang from the 2014 occupy central pro-democracy protests.
they have called for hong kong to break away from china entirely.
they were elected in september, and have attempted to take their oaths several times, but each time have provocatively changed the wording.
their attempts included using a variation of a derogatory word for china, and displaying a pro-independence banner.
their oaths were invalidated amid chaotic scenes in the legislative council (legco).
china's intervention came before a local court could issue its own ruling on whether the pair could be sworn in again.
the beijing ruling states that lawmakers taking their oaths must do so "sincerely and solemnly".
they must "accurately, completely and solemnly" read out the portion of the oath that swears allegiance to beijing, it said.
failure to do so would disqualify the lawmaker from taking office.
while it does not name them, the ruling effectively means mr leung and ms yau will not be allowed to take their seats.
a spokesman for beijing's state council was quoted by xinhua as saying the move was "absolutely necessary", and "complies with the common aspiration of the entire chinese people" including those in hong kong.
li fei, deputy secretary of china's top legislative panel, warned there would be "no obscurity and no leniency" in beijing's "firm and clear attitude towards containing and striking the hong kong independence forces".

carl edwards got the victory he desperately needed to earn a championship-contending spot in the nascar sprint cup finale, winning at texas on sunday night in a race shorted by 41 laps because of rain after the start was delayed nearly six hours.
with his fourth career win at texas, edwards joined jimmie johnson as drivers locked into the championship-contending spots in homestead.
that leaves two spots up for grabs next sunday at phoenix.
edwards entered the second-to-last race before the nov. 22 season finale eighth in points among the drivers still eligible for the championship.
“this is huge.
i don't think it's sunk in yet.
that's all we said was needed, just a shot,” edwards said.
“now we're going to go to homestead, we're going to do what we need to do.
this was a great test.
we came here and did what we needed to do, we performed, and i really believe we can do that at homestead.”
edwards' three joe gibbs racing teammates are among the six other drivers still in contention, and clearly not all of them can advance.
light rain had already been falling, and plenty more was on the radar around the track, when the caution came out with 45 laps remaining of the originally scheduled 334-lap race.
all the cars were brought to pit road four laps later, and it was only a few more minutes before nascar declared the race over and official after 293 laps.
it could have taken two hours or more to dry to track.
the rain-shortened victory was certainly appropriate for edwards after how his championship chase ended last year.
last year's race at phoenix was delayed nearly seven hours as a series of storms passed through the area, and then once it started under the lights was called after 218 laps.
edwards finished fifth, leaving him five points out of the final spot for the chase finale.
it was edwards' fourth win at texas, but his first there in eight years.
he swept the two cup races there in 2008, the season he had nine wins overall and a career-best finish of second in points.
edwards took the lead on lap 258 late sunday after beating martin truex jr. off pit road.
joey logano, another chase contender, finished second while leading a race-high 178 laps.
truex finished third and chase elliott fourth.
logano is third in season points, with kyle busch fourth.
matt kenseth, denny hamlin, kevin harvick and kurt busch are in the fifth through eighth spots.
if one of those six drivers don't win phoenix, the final two championship spots would be determined by points.
trailing after green: polesitter austin dillon led only the race's first six laps, but didn't lead a green-flag lap.
he was passed by logano for the lead on lap 7, the first lap after the green flag.
big bobblehead: the first 30,000 fans were given tony stewart bobbleheads commemorating the retiring sprint cup driver's final race at texas.
during driver introductions, track president eddie gossage presented stewart with his own bobblehead — a life-sized replica with an oversized head.
held out: matt dibenedetto wasn't allowed to drive because of nascar's concussion protocol.
he was involved in a hard crash in the xfinity series race saturday, and wasn't cleared by doctors to drive in the cup race even though he said he felt “perfect” on sunday.
loud pop: a tire specialist for richard childress racing was treated and released from the infield care center after a tire just taken off paul menard's car popped while being checked behind the wall.
up next: phoenix international raceway next sunday.
harvick got his track-record eighth win at phoenix in march, and has won five of the last six races there.
narendra modi’s call came after british prime minister rejected liberalising visa system for indians
anushka asthana political editor, in delhi
monday 7 november 2016 05.48 gmt

india’s prime minister has hinted to theresa may that britain needs to open up its universities to more of its students.
at a conference only hours after the british pm arrived in delhi on a trade mission aimed at boosting economic ties, narendra modi appeared to tackle one of india’s biggest demands of the uk.
addressing a uk-india tech summit he said: “education is vital for our students and will define our engagement in a shared future.
we must therefore encourage greater mobility and participation of young people in education and research opportunities.”
the comments were seen as underlining the importance that indians place on the ability of their students and highly skilled professionals to move across the world.
earlier may had reduced indian hopes for a more liberal visa system, under which more of its nationals wanting to work in the uk could do so, by arguing that the current offer was generous enough.
speaking on the way to delhi for her first bilateral meeting outside europe, the prime minister argued britain was already able to attract the “brightest and best” from outside the eu.
“the figures show that we issue more work visas to india than i think us, australia and china put together.
nine out of 10 visa applications from india are already accepted.
we have, i believe, a good system,” she said.
the comments could prove disappointing for some in the indian government and business community who have argued for increased numbers, and the move could be key for any future trade deals.
may used her speech to the tech summit to insist she wanted an open relationship with india, laying out plans for india to become the first visa country to be put on a registered traveller scheme which helps speed up the experience of visitors in british airports.
“that means for indian nationals who frequently come to the uk – and who fuel growth in both our countries – the entry process will become significantly easier.
fewer forms to fill out, access to eu/eea passport control, swifter passage through our airports,” she said.
despite the reluctance to increase migration numbers from india to the uk, the prime minister delivered a passionate argument for free trade between the two countries arguing that it “creates a rising tide that lifts all boats”.
she said britain was determined not to turn its back on the world, adding: “because we know from history what happens when countries do not embrace the opportunities of the world.
they stagnate, they get poorer, they don’t protect their people, they make them worse off.”
adding that while countries like india did not owe britain a living, she said working together meant the greatest chance of success.
may also said she did not need to wait to leave the eu to start discussions on how trade and investment could be boosted between the countries.
she began the speech by insisting that india and the uk had a special link, listening “to each other’s music” and eating each other’s food, as well as sharing a love of cricket.

health secretary urges against vote on negotiation strategy after court ruling that parliament must start article 50 process

jeremy hunt has said giving mps a vote on theresa may’s brexit negotiating plans would harm the economy, but parliament was “highly likely” to get a vote on the final deal.
last week the prime minister’s plans for leaving the european union were thrown into disarray when three senior judges ruled that parliament, not the executive branch, was responsible for starting the process.
but the health secretary said it would be damaging to force the prime minister to reveal her hand.
“the impact on the economy will be far worse if through some parliamentary mechanisms theresa may is forced to lay out her entire negotiating strategy,” hunt told bbc1’s the andrew marr show.
“parliament passes laws – it always has – but government negotiates treaties,” he said.
“you can’t decide international treaties by a simple vote of mps … you have to give the government latitude to make a deal.”
mps were already involved in scrutinising the plans, hunt said, adding: “government has said it is highly likely there will be a vote to ratify the deal.”
the justice secretary, liz truss, faced criticism this weekend from senior lawyers for failing to condemn media attacks on the high court judges who ruled on the case.
but hunt said: “the idea that the government does not passionately defend the independence of the judiciary and the sovereignty of parliament is absolute nonsense.”
he described the legal challenge as “processology” that was really aimed at stopping the uk from leaving the eu “at all costs”.
the government is to appeal against the ruling to the supreme court, with a hearing expected early next month.
theresa may said on sunday she was confident the court would overturn the decision.
most mps supported the remain campaign, but hunt said he would still expect them to vote in support of leaving the union.
if the lords voted against the proposal it would be “incredibly difficult” and “unprecedented”, but, he said: “i think it’s highly unlikely that parliament wouldn’t in the end back a decision to trigger article 50.”
hunt earlier warned: “the damage to the fabric of our democracy would be far, far worse if people felt the establishment was trying to unpick the decision they have made.”
he aimed to play down suggestions that fallout from the court case could force an early general election.
“i think a general election is, frankly, the last thing the government wants.
theresa may wants to get on with the job – and, frankly, it’s the last thing the british people want,” he said.
meanwhile, gina miller, the businesswoman behind the successful legal challenge, said the high court ruling had stopped the government behaving like a “tinpot dictatorship”.
the investment fund manager and philanthropist also said the press had “behaved disgracefully” following the court judgment.
she told andrew marr: “this is about creating legal certainty and, actually, everyone in the country should be my biggest fan because i’ve used my own money, and a few of us used our own money, to create legal certainty for mrs may to move ahead.”
she said it was “misdirection” to claim that the decision was unpicking parliamentary sovereignty.
“the case is that she cannot use something called the royal prerogative to do it because we do not live in a tinpot dictatorship,” she said.
miller, 51, was born in guyana but grew up in britain.
she co-founded the firm scm private and previously launched a campaign with her hedge-fund manager husband, alan, against mis-selling and hidden fund charges in the city of london’s fund management industry.
reaction to the brexit case had been fuelled by sexism, racism and homophobia, she said.
“i was aware there would be nastiness because if there’s anything to do with the word brexit, people lose their minds and it’s all about heart,” she said.
nigel farage warned there would be disturbances on the streets if parliament attempted to thwart brexit.
the interim ukip leader said political anger – “the likes of which none of us in our lifetimes have ever witnessed” – would emerge if voters felt they were going to be “cheated” over the june referendum result to leave the eu.
he called on brexit backers to “get even” through peaceful protests and oppose at the ballot box anyone who sought to overturn the process.
but farage claimed he was “finished” with party politics, as he sought to play down the possibility of him returning to the long-term leadership of ukip.
the mep said: “we may have seen bob geldof and 40,000 people in parliament square moaning about brexit.
believe you me, if the people in this country think they’re going to be cheated, they’re going to be betrayed, then we will see political anger the likes of which none of us in our lifetimes have ever witnessed in this country.
those newspaper headlines are reflecting that.”
asked if there was a real danger of “disturbance in the streets” if brexit was thwarted by parliament, farage replied: “i think that’s right.
i heard you talking to gina miller earlier about the nasty things that have been said about her.
believe you me, i’ve had years of this, i’ve had years of hate mobs – taxpayer-funded hate mobs – chasing me around britain.
“the temperature of this is very, very high.
now, i’m going to say to everybody watching this who was on the brexit side: let’s try to get even, let’s have peaceful protests and let’s make sure in any form of election we don’t support people who want to overturn this process.”

istanbul —  turkey's pro-kurdish party announced sunday that it will halt its legislative activities in parliament following the arrests of nine of its lawmakers, a move the prime minister called a mistake.
peoples' democratic party spokesman ayhan bilgen said at a news conference in the southeastern city of diyarbakir that the party will stop participating in parliamentary commissions and the parliamentary assembly.
bilgen later told the associated press that the party does not plan to withdraw from parliament.
pulling out of parliament is a decision that only can "be made in consultation with the people," he said.
the party, known as the hdp, therefore plans to gauge public opinion following "the most extensive and darkest attack in our democratic political history," he said.
turkish prime minister binali yildirim called on the hdp in a televised speech from the northeastern city of bayburt to "return from this mistake before it's too late."

hdp lawmakers would be disrespecting the voters who elected them if they do not represent them in parliament, yildirim said.
"come to the parliament and say whatever you want, but no politician can be a shield to terror by abusing their position," the prime minister said.
hdp co-leaders selahattin demirtas and figen yuksekdag were arrested friday on terrorism-related charges, along with seven other lawmakers.
the hdp entered parliament last year as the nation's third-largest party with 59 lawmakers.
turkey's government accuses the hdp of being the political wing of the outlawed kurdistan workers' party or pkk, which has waged a three-decades-long insurgency against the state.
the party rejects the accusation.
in may, turkey's parliament voted to strip lawmakers of legal immunity, paving the way for last week's arrests.
hundreds of charges were filed against hdp lawmakers following the new measure and the party decided not to voluntarily appear in court to testify.
turkish president recep tayyip erdogan lashed out at european countries that have condemned the arrests as undermining democracy.
he blamed europe for supporting and arming the pkk.
erdogan said security forces have captured thousands of weapons from the pkk with western origins, among them heavy weapons.
"they say they gave the weapons to iraqi coalition forces and that they (pkk) must have gotten them from there," erdogan said without specifying the countries to which he was referring.
"who are you kidding?
you are giving these directly to them."

jürgen klopp has told liverpool to “stay cool” after going top of the premier league and warned potential title rivals that his free-scoring team will improve as the season progresses.
liverpool reached the premier league summit for the first time since may 2014 with an emphatic 6-1 victory over watford at anfield.
arsenal’s 1-1 draw with tottenham hotspur in the north london derby earlier in the day had offered klopp’s team the chance to leapfrog manchester city, chelsea and arsène wenger’s side, and they took it with another irrepressible attacking display.
sadio mané scored twice, while philippe coutinho, emre can, roberto firmino and georginio wijnaldum, with his first for the club, were all on the scoresheet for a liverpool team that have had 13 different goalscorers in 14 matches this season.
but their manager remained grounded.
“if somebody thinks being one point ahead after 11 match days is a big sign for the rest of the season then i can’t help this person,” said klopp.
“we stay cool.
it’s the best position i can imagine but nothing else has happened.
we knew that arsenal drew against tottenham but we didn’t speak one word before the game about the possibility of being top of the table.
the only thing you can do is work and stay concentrated.
a lot of different things could happen in the next few weeks and months, how positive they are is up to us.
“there’s no pressure after 11 match days, absolutely no pressure at all.
we saw chelsea yesterday – quite impressive.
manchester city playing barcelona – quite impressive.
man united – never write them off.
tottenham – a really good side.
there are a lot of really good teams around.
you can play a really good season but finish fifth or sixth and nobody would be really happy.
“stay cool, take the things like they are, play your best, win games, that’s the only thing we can do.
when i came here i asked for time and patience and belief and after 11 match days everyone’s asking for guarantees that are not there.
the only thing we have for sure is a pretty good football team.
we are still early in our development and a lot of things can be improved.”
watford had kept three clean sheets before their arrival at anfield but their defence was ravaged and heurelho gomes departed with his right knee in a brace.
the 35-year-old goalkeeper will have a scan in the next few days.
“in my opinion you can lose against a team like liverpool at their home but i’m not happy to lose in this way,” said their manager, walter mazzarri.
“we have to work tactically and psychologically to play against a team like this again.
we had too many players not on form but also congratulations to liverpool.
from the teams we’ve played there’s no doubt they are the team i’m most impressed with.
if they continue like this they are number one in my list for winning the premier league from the teams we’ve played against.”

on bt sport, howard webb says the arsenal goal was the correct decision.
in short, the law’s an ass, not the referee.

new delhi —  india's capital announced a slew of measures sunday to combat the crippling air pollution that has engulfed the city, including closing down schools, halting construction and ordering that all roads be doused with water to settle dust.
new delhi, one of the world's dirtiest cities, saw levels of pm2.5 — tiny particulate matter that can clog lungs — soar to over 900 micrograms per cubic meter on saturday.
that's more than 90 times the level considered safe by the world health organization and 15 times the indian government's norms.
the severe weekend pollution followed a week of constant gray smog.
new delhi's chief minister, arvind kejriwal, told reporters after an emergency meeting of his cabinet on sunday that schools would be shut for three days, and all construction and demolition activity halted for at least five days.
he also said a coal-fueled power plant on the edges of the city would be shut for 10 days.
the other measures announced include a 10-day ban on the use of all diesel-powered electricity generators, except at places such as hospitals and cellphone towers.
starting thursday, all major roads in the city will be vacuum cleaned once a week, kejriwal said.
the chief minister also said people should avoid going outdoors until the pollution levels drop and should try to work from home as much as possible.

new delhi's air pollution soars during the cooler winter months, bringing health troubles to millions, especially children and older people.
kejriwal said that a major contributor to new delhi's pollution is the crop fires in neighboring states.
at the start of every winter, farmers in the states of punjab, haryana and uttar pradesh begin burning straw from their rice paddy crop to clear the fields for planting wheat.
the centre for science and environment, a new delhi-based research and lobbying organization, said government data shows that the smog that has covered the city for the last week is the worst in 17 years.
over the last few years, new delhi's government has tried a handful of methods to control air pollution, including stricter emission norms for cars and a tax on diesel-fueled trucks that enter the city.
it has also barred the burning of leaves and garbage in the city.
earlier this year, the city reduced the number of cars on the roads during the winter months, when air quality is at its worst.
twice the city imposed a two-week period in which cars were allowed on the roads only on even or odd days, depending on the vehicle's license plate number.
on sunday, kejriwal said that the government was assessing whether it needed to reduce the number of cars again.

the fbi says it has found no evidence of criminality in a new batch of hillary clinton emails, boosting her campaign two days before the election.
fbi director james comey told congress his agency's review had found nothing to alter its original conclusion.
in july, he said mrs clinton had been careless but not criminal in handling sensitive material on her private email server while secretary of state.
the issue flared up again with the discovery of new "pertinent" emails.
they were reportedly found on the laptop of anthony weiner, the estranged husband of one of the democratic presidential candidate's closest advisers.
mr comey's letter to congress late last month, revealing the bureau's inquiry into mrs clinton's emails had been revived, shook up the white house race and reinvigorated the campaign of republican nominee donald trump.
it was much ado about nothing, but it certainly amounted to something.
while fbi director james comey, in effect, said "never mind" with regards to hillary clinton's emails, for the past two weeks the story has dominated the political conversation, and democrats have paid a price.
while mrs clinton's presidential hopes have stabilised, talk of a possible rout - and sweeping down-ballot victories in congressional races - are a distant memory.
mrs clinton will now try to focus on her closing campaign message.
donald trump almost certainly will continue to accuse his opponent of corruption and, perhaps, again allege the fbi is covering for her.
with only two days until voting, the dust kicked up by this story won't have fully settled by the time americans head to the polls.
once this election is over, there should be serious soul-searching within the fbi and the media about how this saga played out.
the nation's top law-enforcement agency was a source of constant leaks, as internal disputes spilled into public view.
if mr trump wins, many on the left will blame mr comey for the result.
if mrs clinton prevails, she likely will bear a lasting grudge over this political near-miss.
how fbi email verdict affects election
the fbi director had announced that the agency would investigate if the newly discovered messages contained classified information.
but in sunday's follow-up, mr comey wrote: "since my letter, the fbi investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation.
"during that process, we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from hillary clinton while she was secretary of state.
"based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in july with respect to secretary clinton."
on board the candidate's campaign airplane, her team said they were always confident of the outcome.
communications director jennifer palmieri told media: "we're glad this matter has been resolved."
but the trump team cried foul.
newt gingrich, an adviser to the republican nominee, tweeted: "comey must be under enormous political pressure to cave like this and announce something he cant [sic] possibly know."
trump campaign manager kellyanne conway tweeted: "if fbi conclusions remain unchanged, that means she still was reckless & careless, still lied about classified info, lied re: # of devices."
campaigning in minnesota on sunday, mr trump made no mention of mr comey's findings.
but he did say mrs clinton "will be under investigation for a long, long time, likely concluding in a criminal trial".
he also renewed his claims that the democrat was being "protected by a rigged system".
the fbi has already established mrs clinton had classified information on a private email server that was run out of her upstate new york home.
mr comey said in july that her handling of sensitive material during her 2009-13 tenure as secretary of state was "extremely careless", but cleared her of criminal wrongdoing.
the revelation that she handled sensitive information while breaking federal rules by running her own email server has dogged her campaign since last year.
a new nbc/wall st journal opinion poll on sunday before news broke of the fbi letter suggested a four-point lead for mrs clinton.
the latest washington post/abc tracking poll put her lead at five points.
sunday's campaign stops take her to ohio, michigan, pennsylvania and new hampshire.
also on mr trump's itinerary were iowa, michigan, pennsylvania and virginia.

seoul, south korea —  in only a few days, south korea's biggest scandal in years has done what six decades of diplomacy and bloodshed couldn't.
it has united the rival koreas, at least in one area: indignation against south korea's leader.
north korea's propaganda mavens have never been shy in calling south korean president park geun-hye an incompetent, power-hungry clone of her late dictator father, park chung-hee — and that's when they're pulling their punches.
inconceivable a week ago, many south koreans now seem to be reaching pyongyang levels of fury over an investigation into whether park allowed a longtime confidante with no official government role to manipulate her administration from the shadows.
the north's fondness for vicious threats is generally missing in the south, but the anger over the scandal — sometimes partisan, mostly spontaneous on the part of many south koreans, but more violent and somewhat canned in the north, where carefully cultivated outrage is a state commodity — often seems to be in lockstep.
for instance, in wording that north korea would be right at home with, ahn cheol-soo, a lawmaker from a small south korean opposition party and a potential presidential candidate, recently said of park: "you no longer have the authority to destroy the constitution.
you no longer have the authority to stomp on the pride of our people."
advertisement
here's how a similar sentiment looked when north korea's main newspaper recently attacked park: "it's deplorable that the south's politics have become the joke of the world and its economy and people's livelihoods are left in shreds."
to be clear, the expressions in south korea, even at their sharpest, are still a long way from the odious linguistic swamp of violence and sexism that characterizes much of north korea's propaganda.
the north, for instance, has called park a "dirty prostitute who licks her master's groin," an "aging witch," a "female dog" and an "american parrot."
pyongyang has also repeatedly called for her death.
but there has been an uptick in both rage and sexism in the south, especially online, where park and her confidante, choi soon-sil, have been called "crazy bitch," ''chicken head," a slur meant to attack their intelligence, and "stupid gangnam ajumma," a term often used to insult middle-aged women living in affluent southern seoul.
people have also declared that south korea will never again vote for a female president or trust a woman's leadership.
it is not just happening in obscure corners of south korea's social media or the web, never the cream of public discourse.
"park geun-hye threw away her authority as (the person) ultimately responsible (for governing the state) to a common street woman of unknown roots," jae-myung lee, the opposition mayor of seongnam, told more than 10,000 people taking part in a recent anti-park rally, referring to choi.
"park has lost her authority as president and has shown that she doesn't have the basic qualities to govern a country."
that park, who has 15 months to go in her single five-year term, should go has long been a mainstay of north korean rhetoric.
but similar sentiments are also emerging in south korean media.
"if we had to pick one person who made the country into the shattered mess that it is now, it's none other than president park," the south's kyunghyang shinmun newspaper said in an editorial on saturday, calling for park's resignation.
"the citizens no longer want park to govern state affairs ... she lost the political leadership to persuade and guide the ruling and opposition parties, the parliament and the people.
her moral authority as the head of state has fallen to the ground ...
continuing this state for another year and three months will make everyone miserable."
north korea's state media have at times seemed overwhelmed with the amount of negative stories, both international and south korean, about park, and have often just rounded up the coverage, with some insulting comment added.
advertisement
six days after park first acknowledged that she had sent choi, the daughter of a shadowy religious figure who emerged as park's mentor in the 1970s, drafts of her speeches for editing, north korea's main newspaper, rodong sinmun, released a lengthy, painstaking summary of the saga, replete with sexist, violent insults.
the newspaper described park and choi as "two women who have lost their minds."
it also broke down reports that choi influenced important government decisions, including park's move to shut down the last major symbol of inter-korean cooperation, a jointly run factory park in the north korean city of kaesong.
"this shows to the world that park geun-hye is not merely a first-class dog controlled by a large monster that is the united states, but also doubly and triply a puppet manipulated by strings pulled by one 'gangnam' woman," the north korean newspaper said, referring to the seoul neighborhood where choi reportedly built a fortune on real estate investments.
observers of north korean propaganda have wondered about the length of time it took the newspaper, the mouthpiece of the ruling workers' party, to weigh in on the scandal — nearly a week.
it's almost as if the paper's propaganda experts, after firing at much smaller targets for so long, couldn't quite believe the huge gift they'd been given.
pyongyang has more recently stepped things up.
for instance, the north's official korean central news agency published a statement by a foreign ministry unit said that park's actions had caused a "hideous power-backed scandal unprecedented in history."
it predicted that a "mass struggle" of enraged south koreans will leave park at a crossroads where she is forced to choose between quitting her presidency on her own or facing impeachment.
with tens of thousands of south korean protesters calling for park's ouster over the weekend and bigger crowds expected in coming days, pyongyang's breathless, over-the-top propaganda might not be so far off the mark.

donald trump has accused the fbi of impropriety after it once again said that hillary clinton should not face criminal charges over her emails.
the fbi director said a fresh inquiry into the democratic candidate's communications found nothing to change the bureau's conclusion this summer.
the clinton campaign said it was "glad" the lingering issue had been resolved.
the dramatic twist lifted a cloud from her campaign as the final day of the marathon us election race loomed.
the latest opinion polls on sunday, before news broke of the fbi announcement, gave mrs clinton a four- to five-point lead over mr trump.
mrs clinton used a private email server when she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 in the obama administration.
the republican nominee cried foul after learning about the law enforcement bureau's decision.
at a rally in the detroit suburbs, mr trump insisted it would have been impossible for the fbi to review what has been reported to be as many as 650,000 emails in such a short time.
"right now she's being protected by a rigged system.
it's a totally rigged system.
i've been saying it for a long time," he told supporters in sterling heights, michigan.
"hillary clinton is guilty, she knows it, the fbi knows it, the people know it and now it's up to the american people to deliver justice at the ballot box on 8 november."
while mrs clinton herself did not address the fbi director's letter on the trail, her campaign said it was always confident she would be cleared.
what we know about the new emails
in manchester, new hampshire, on sunday, she said the country was facing "a moment of reckoning" and americans must choose between "division and unity".
in july, the fbi said she had been "extremely careless" to handle classified material on a private email server as secretary of state from 2009-13, but it had found no evidence she committed a crime.
however, 11 days before the election, fbi director james comey had pitched the race into turmoil by announcing a newly discovered batch of clinton emails would be investigated.
the bombshell infuriated the clinton camp, but threw a lifeline to a trump campaign that had been receding in the polls.
it was much ado about nothing, but it certainly amounted to something.
while fbi director james comey, in effect, said "never mind" with regards to hillary clinton's emails, for the past two weeks the story has dominated the political conversation, and democrats have paid a price.

if mr trump wins, many on the left will blame mr comey for the result.
if mrs clinton prevails, she likely will bear a lasting grudge over this political near-miss.
how fbi email verdict affects election
clinton emails - what's it all about?
in a letter to congress on sunday, mr comey said his investigators had "worked around the clock" on the latest emails, which were found in early october in a separate investigation.
the messages reportedly turned up on a laptop belonging to anthony weiner, the estranged husband of one of mrs clinton's closest advisers.
mr weiner is accused of sending illicit messages to a 15-year-old girl.
mr comey said investigators had found no reason to change the fbi's earlier assessment that mrs clinton should not be charged for her handing of classified information.
donald trump may have kept his supporters in leesburg waiting for three hours at his final rally of the day on sunday, but any anger was reserved for his rival.
"i'm insulted and terrified the fbi has finished its investigation so quickly," said nicole calisti, in her 40s.
"what does that say about america?"
"hillary should be in prison.
she's a criminal and a fake," declared 42-year-old amy rodgers.
when trump did eventually arrive, his usual attacks against "crooked hillary" were met with a chorus of "lock her up" chants and a bellow of boos.
almost nothing else was quite as vitriolic.
for republicans, it seems the email server scandal is far from over.
government officials told us media that investigators had established the newly found emails were either personal, or were duplicates of correspondence they had previously reviewed.
senate democratic leader harry reid said mr comey's conclusion "underscores the irresponsibility" of the law enforcement chief's notice late last month to congress about mrs clinton.
both candidates are set for a whistle-stop tour of battleground states on monday, in a last-ditch dash for votes.
mrs clinton starts the day in michigan, a traditional rust belt, democratic stronghold that has been heavily targeted by mr trump in recent days.
she will then head to philadelphia where she will be joined by president barack obama, first lady michelle obama, husband bill clinton, and bruce springsteen.

the democratic candidate will end her white house campaign with a midnight "get out the vote rally" in north carolina.
mr trump heads to florida, north carolina and philadelphia before ending with a rally in grand rapids, michigan.
in states where early voting is allowed, nearly 42 million americans have already cast ballots in the presidential election.
they have turned out in record numbers in crucial battlegrounds such as florida, north carolina and nevada.
an estimated 126 million voters cast ballots in the 2012 white house election.
it appears fbi director james comey has again sprung a surprise in the us presidential race:  usa today said his announcement, which came just days after saying a fresh inquiry was under way, was "stunning".
for the la times, it undercuts a central argument mr trump has been making against mrs clinton, that "if elected, clinton would be crippled by a federal indictment and a tangle of congressional investigations into her email server".
mrs clinton's supporters are now confident she is heading for victory, according to the hill.
"she's got it," a friend told the site, while another aide replied to a question about how he was feeling "by sending a celebratory emoji".
mr comey's move is likely to raise questions among democrats, writes the new york times.
"most important among them: why did mr. comey raise the spectre of wrongdoing before agents had even read the emails, especially since it took only days to determine that they were not significant?"
the washington post meanwhile says both republicans and democrats are likely to be arguing for years over the impacts of the email saga, warning it will "further undermine the legitimacy of whoever wins the election in this deeply polarised country".

melvin gordon ran for a career-high 196 yards and had the go-ahead touchdown on a one-yard run, and defensive backs dwight lowery and brandon flowers scored on turnovers by marcus mariota to lead the chargers to a 43-35 victory sunday against the tennessee titans, who still haven't won in san diego since 1990.
the chargers (4-5) won two days before the team will ask voters to approve a billion-dollar subsidy for a new downtown stadium to replace aging qualcomm stadium.
the measure was polling well short of the two-thirds supermajority needed to pass.
gordon, who leads the nfl with 11 touchdowns, scored on a 1-yard run with 5:28 left in the third quarter to give the chargers a 26-21 lead.
he ran 32 times, and broke a 47-yard run in the closing minutes.
he also caught four passes for 65 yards.
mariota, who led the titans to a 21-19 lead by guiding two quick scoring drives on either side of halftime, helped the chargers surge to a 12-point lead when he fumbled late in the third quarter.
lowery picked up the ball ran 43 yards for a touchdown and a 33-21 lead.
with the chargers up by eight — and with a propensity to blow late leads this year — flowers jumped a route, intercepted mariota and returned it 33 yards for a 43-28 lead with 4:51 left.
running the two-minute drill to perfection, mariota threw a 7-yard scoring pass to rishard matthews with 14 seconds left before halftime.
the titans got the second-half kick and mariota quickly moved them down the field, finishing the drive with a 14-yard run on which he held out the ball to touch the pylon.
the chargers came right back with a drive aided by three crucial penalties by the titans' defense to get gordon's go-ahead score.
the titans pulled to 33-28 with just less than 10 minutes to play when mariota hit delanie walker on an 8-yard scoring pass.
the titans (4-5) have lost seven straight in san diego since 1993, when they were the houston oilers.
the franchise's last victory in san diego was in 1990.
philip rivers threw a 13-yard td pass to antonio gates in the first quarter and a 6-yarder to tyrell williams in the second for a 16-0 chargers lead.
mariota, who passed for 313 yards and three tds, also threw a 16-yard td pass to matthews in the second quarter.
san diego held demarco murray to 51 yards on 14 carries.
he scored on a 1-yard run late in the game.
capital’s schools closed for three days and building work halted as harmful pollutants reach level more than 16 times safe limit
michael safi
sunday 6 november 2016 16.40 gmt
the indian government has declared severe levels of toxic air pollution in delhi an “emergency situation” as administrators announce a plan to temporarily shut construction sites and a coal-fired power station to bring the situation under control.
schools in the capital will be closed for three days and traffic may be rationed, following six days of heavy smog and concentrations of harmful particles so high they cannot be measured by most air quality instruments.
the level of pm2.5 pollutants, which are the most harmful because they can reach deep into the lungs and breach the blood-brain barrier, have reached at least 999 in parts of the city this week, more than 16 times the safe limit of 60.
on sunday, delhi’s chief minister, arvind kejriwal, announced emergency measures aimed at protecting residents, including a five-day ban on construction and demolition, thought to be a major contributor to pollution levels.
bulldozers are to be used to put out fires at the bhalswa landfill, which constantly smoulders.
kejriwal said: “people should stay home as much as they can [and] work from home.”
a coal-fired power station in badarpur, south-east delhi, will stop operating for 10 days, along with diesel generators in the city.
kejriwal has called on neighbouring states to enforce laws against burning agricultural waste.
around this time each year, hundreds of thousands of farmers in haryana and punjab set their fields on fire to dispose of crop remnants, sending smoke billowing across india’s northern plains.
the delhi government is preparing to reintroduce a temporary scheme to only allow cars to drive on odd or even days depending on the last digit of their registration numbers.
airborne pollution in delhi rarely stays within safe levels, even during summer, when winds are stronger and dust and droplets disperse more easily in the hot air.
it is traditionally worst in the winter months, beginning with diwali, when hundreds of thousands of fireworks are let off across the city.
they leave a haze that usually lasts for two or three days, but has persisted for almost a week this year.
the centre for science and environment, a delhi-based ngo, has said the air quality is the worst the indian capital had seen in 17 years.
hospitals in the city have reported increased admissions of people suffering respiratory diseases – of which india has the highest rate in the world, with 159 deaths per 100,000 people in 2012, according to the world health organisation.
children are particularly vulnerable, a 2015 study finding about half the city’s 4.4 million schoolchildren had stunted lung development and would never completely recover.
arti maria, an associate professor of paediatrics at the ram manohar lohia hospital told local media the air was “killing presently”.
“[the] presence of even little smoke is considered harmful for newborn and toddlers.
the air quality right now can lead to slow brain development, mental irritation and psychological problems,” she said.
businesses are reportedly suffering as a result of this week’s fog and the low visibility was blamed for a 20-car pile up a major delhi expressway on thursday.
the city struggled with poor air quality in the 1990s but managed to clear its atmosphere by raising emissions standards for vehicles, mandating its fleet of taxis and buses use compressed natural gas and moving some heavy industry to the outskirts of the city.
other than smoke from fires in neighbouring states, the city’s poor air is attributed to a combination of road dust, exhaust fumes, industrial emissions and open fires, including those lit by poorer residents to cook and keep warm.

police in hong kong have used pepper spray to disperse thousands of protesters angry at china's plans that could stop two pro-independence legislators from taking their seats.
beijing is now interpreting one of hong kong's laws to ban sixtus leung and yau wai-ching.
a decision is due on monday.
china is acting within its legal rights, but many in hong kong accuse beijing of ruling by decree.
the top legislative panel in china said beijing must intervene in the dispute.
it added that it should deter advocates of hong kong independence, as their actions were a threat to national security, state news agency xinhua reported.
some demonstrators scuffled with police in front of the office of china's representative in the territory.
protesters used umbrellas to shield themselves from the spray, and some threw bottles at police.
organisers said there were at least 10,000 protesters in the march.
police said there were 8,000 people at the peak of the demonstration.
two men were arrested for obstructing police duties and refusing to show their identification cards, police added.
there was a lot of anger directed at beijing during the protests.
various demonstrators told me they felt beijing was acting as a "big brother" or ruling by decree, and undermining the rule of law in hong kong.
the clashes that broke out after dark also fit a recent pattern.
protests organised by pro-democracy groups tend to be orderly and family friendly during the day, with police and demonstrators co-operating to some extent to allow traffic to pass through at certain times.
but more confrontational groups may stay on after the official march ends, staging sit ins or, as in this case, marching away from the route agreed with police and scuffling with officers.
it reflects a change in hong kong politics.
in the past, many saw peaceful protest as the best way to bring about change.
but in the last few years, some protesters have become more confrontational - arguing that playing by the rules has not achieved anything.
the issue started when the two lawmakers pledged allegiance to the "hong kong nation" and displayed a "hong kong is not china" banner during a swearing-in ceremony of the city's legislative council, the territory's parliament, last month.
their oaths were not accepted, and a local hong kong court has been looking into the case.
however, china announced that its parliament would invoke its rarely used power to interpret hong kong's mini constitution, the basic law, to prevent them from taking office.
the case has been seen by many in hong kong as a risk to the freedoms granted to the former british colony when it was handed back to china in 1997, which included a high degree of autonomy, and judicial independence.

call it a crude show down for the ages.
two of the most respected commodities experts on wall street duked it out recently over oil's next stop, and whether opec would be a catalyst for driving prices higher or lower.
in one corner, "commodities king" dennis gartman maintained that opec cheats and that the word of the cartel should not be trusted.
in the other corner, helima croft of rbc capital markets reiterated that the organization of the petroleum exporting countries will strike a deal, which will ultimately drive the price of crude higher.
"it's going to be very difficult to get wti much below $40," gartman told "futures now" last week.
however, while he noted that a panic liquidation could driver prices towards $38, gartman maintained that $52 oil would be a difficult target to achieve given the current climate.
"we may well be stuck within a broad range.
call it $38 on the low side and $52 on the high side."
following a segment on cnbc on tuesday, gartman again cast his doubts over opec's rhetoric and emphasized that the cartel, "cheats no matter what happens.
they have no choice.
and i think that cheating, which has been endemic to opec since its inception, will simply continue."
croft, who has been bullish on oil throughout the course of 2016, took issue with gartman's assessment of opec's practices.
"we remain convinced that opec will stick this landing," explained rbc's global head of commodity strategy, ahead of the upcoming opec meeting on november 30th.
"yes, left to their own devices, opec countries will cheat.
but, what i think is different this time is that almost all of the opec countries are flat out producing."
given the current levels of production, croft said iraq likely doesn't have many more barrels to put on the market.
additionally, she noted a drop in production for venezuela.
the one wild card appears to be saudi arabia, the world's largest oil producer.
croft insisted the kingdom is ready to play ball.
"saudi arabia wants this deal to fly because of their own domestic priorities," explained croft in regard to how the nation's economy is largely dependent on steady oil prices.
specifically, with plans to take saudi aramco public, the kingdom can't afford volatility in the coming year as the offering could be worth as much as $2 trillion in a stable market.
"i expect them to get the deal done.
if venezuela could cheat, they would, but i think they're all out of bullets at this point," croft said.
croft added that, while the price of oil could head lower before the meeting thanks to widespread skepticism and bearish headlines, her firm is firm on its call for $60 oil.
however, the trend has not been rbc's friend lately.
west texas intermediate slid to a low below $44 last week, its weakest since september and down nearly 10 percent in a week.
with this in mind, gartman had to respectfully push back on croft's views.
he drew attention to the words of mohammad bin salman al saud, the saudi deputy crown prince, who recently said that his nation's oil becomes a spoiled asset if they don't continue to produce and sell it at competitively.
given the abundance of crude out of riyadh, gartman noted it wouldn't be unheard of if they put an additional million barrels on the market each month.
"i don't think saudi has an additional million barrels," croft fired back after referencing the nation's output in july, which was largely regarded as peak production at 10.65 million barrels.
"saudi arabia is the one that switched their policy.
they are the ones now begging iran, and now exempting iran [as well as nigeria and libya], because they want this done."
given the saudi's reported desire to strike a deal, croft anticipates that they'll in fact drop production below the january levels of 10.2 million, while allowing rival nations to continue producing at near-record levels.
furthermore, croft believes that saudi arabia is in the driver seat because gulf nations like quarter, uae and kuwait historically follow the example set by saudi arabia when it comes to production.
according to international energy agency, oil supply is expected to outpace demand through the first half of 2017.
that said, gartman admitted that a potential deal could emerge in vienna later this month.
still, "all i can do is remain bearish of crude oil.
as long as informed money is moving in one direction, i shall move in that direction," gartman argued.

with the u.s. at the polls on tuesday, the fbi on sunday said that after examining new emails related to its probe of clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, the agency's view was unchanged from july, when it first said it did not find evidence to support criminal charges.

fbi director james comey had written a letter to congress on october 28 to inform it the agency was probing newly discovered emails related to its investigation of clinton's use of the private server for government-related emails - a move that dramatically hiked uncertainty around the election, as republican rival donald trump overtook clinton in some polls.

after the fbi announcement, the mexican peso rose against the greenback, at 18.6837 compared to levels above 19 pesos last week.
the peso is seen as a proxy for trump's hopes of winning the election, due to his vocal anti-mexico stance.
"the canadian dollar and the mexican peso, the two benchmarks for the election due to their close geographic and economic ties with the us, gained strength as a clinton white house becomes a symbol for continental trade and prosperity," said anthony darvall, chief market strategist at easymarkets.

the u.s. presidential campaign is entering its final days, with polls showing a tight race between democratic nominee hillary clinton and republican nominee donald trump.
on sunday, the federal bureau of investigation (fbi) again cleared clinton of potential criminal charges over her use of a private email server for government business while  secretary of state.
the fbi's decision to reveal an extended probe just over a week ago had slowed clinton's momentum in the polls, allowing trump to catch up.

for the many fight fans he let down while losing to floyd mayweather jr. last year, manny pacquiao has staged a redemption tour.
his second follow-up victory came saturday night, a convincing, unanimous-decision triumph over jessie vargas that  the retired mayweather  watched from ringside and  that stoked talk that   pacquiao and he will fight again.
“if the rematch happens, i want to make sure the fans love it,” pacquiao told reporters from his las vegas suite sunday.
“i will give all i can to give my best to the fans.”
pacquiao (59-6-2) took great satisfaction in doing so again saturday, when he claimed the world boxing organization welterweight belt for a fourth time.
in front of 16,132 at thomas and mack center — including 7,000 in the upper deck who embraced pacquiao’s $50 ticket price — the first-term senator from the philippines knocked vargas down in the second round and proceeded to a 115-113, 118-109, 118-109 victory on the scorecards.
judge dave moretti’s narrow  scoring was soundly panned.
“i was looking for a knockout and was so eager to put on a good fight,” pacquiao said.
“[vargas] said he would fight toe to toe.
he changed, he adapted, and i had to be careful  not to be careless.”
referee kenny bayless missed two more pacquiao knockdowns in the 11th  and 12th  rounds, respectively, calling them slips, but pacquiao’s complete victory was revealed in punch statistics that showed vargas landed just 104 of 561 punches, while pacquiao smacked vargas with 101 of 212 power shots.
though he’ll be 38 next month and  his senate workload  forced him to spend six weeks of training camp in the philippines, pacquiao produced a showing that mayweather rated  “not bad.”
mayweather turns 40 in february, and could finish 50-0 should he opt  for a rematch of a fight he convincingly won as pacquiao labored through a serious shoulder injury.
when someone asked  pacquiao how much he had left in the tank sunday, he spoke of how much fresher he felt  than in his past two bouts and replied, “full tank.”
“i thought manny performed extraordinarily well,” pacquiao promoter bob arum said.
“when he’s moving and punching like that, disappears around a guy and comes out on the other side throwing punches — that’s great craftsmanship.”
in april, pacquiao scored two knockdowns to defeat former two-division champion timothy bradley jr.
“he was very quick on his feet,” vargas said of pacquiao.
“when bradley complained about his toes [in fighting pacquiao], you definitely have to stay on your toes.
he was quick.”
photos from the wbo welterweight title fight between challenger manny pacquiao and champion jessie vargas.
and now, after mayweather accepted a pacquiao invitation to attend the fight, the question is  whether they will meet again after their long-anticipated may 2015 bout generated a record 4.6 million pay-per-view buys and more than $600 million.
“there’s no discussions for now and that’s not in my mind right now,” said pacquiao, who resumes senate work tuesday.
yet the  invitation revealed the free communication that exists between pacquiao and mayweather now, in contrast to the situation before the long-delayed first fight.
back then,   as arum and mayweather manager al haymon presided  over talks that repeatedly failed, it took a chance face-to-face meeting at an nba game to propel the fighters to strike a deal.
“because we have this contact now, this can be easier to talk about if there is a rematch,” pacquiao said.
even if super-lightweight terence crawford and super-featherweight champion vasyl lomachenko would be in consideration for pacquiao too, mayweather is of most interest.
“not only for myself, but if the fans in boxing want that rematch, then why not?” pacquiao said.
“we can easily talk about that.
it’s not a problem.”
pacquiao said he’s aware boxing pay-per-view sales have languished since his loss to mayweather, saying he “will do all i can do” to rebuild interest and give fight fans better value next time around.
saturday night, with pacquiao waving his right glove to mayweather just before the first bell and delivering  a knowing grin when victory seemed secure before the 12th, will keep the subject on boxing’s front burner for the next few months.
todd duboef, arum’s stepson and his company’s president, embraced mayweather at the fight and said it will be intriguing to see how  matters transpire.
“it’s good for banter.
it’s good for headlines,” duboef said.

theresa may has rejected calls to relax indian visa rules, saying the uk has a "good system" for applications.
the prime minister, who is in delhi to pave the way for the uk's first post-brexit trade deal, said the uk was already able to attract "the brightest and the best" from outside the eu.
"nine out of 10 visa applications from india are already accepted," she said.
but she said the uk could give ground if indians who overstayed their visas could be returned more swiftly.
"the uk will consider further improvements to our visa offer if, at the same time, we can step up the speed and volume of returns of indians with no right to remain," she told reporters.
her government also intends to make it easier for wealthy indian business executives to come to the uk.
a small group of high-net-worth individuals and their families will be offered access to the great club - a bespoke visa and immigration service - to make visa applications smoother.
thousands of indians on work visas will also be able to join the registered travellers scheme which will mean they can get through uk border controls more quickly.
"as we leave the eu, we want to ensure that the uk remains one of the most attractive countries in the world to do business and invest," mrs may said.
the prime minister flew into delhi late last night to be greeted by the worst smog this city has seen in nearly 20 years.
where better to get a taste of life beyond the eu - than india.
with such deep historical links between the two countries - surely the uk can cut through the bureaucratic smog that saw brussels spend nearly a decade negotiating, but ultimately fail to agree a deal with the world's fastest growing economy.
but indian business leaders are confused.
no-one knows what the uk's relationship with europe will eventually look like, and many are unsure about how much can be usefully discussed until the uk has withdrawn from the eu - a point that is at least two years away.
some things are clear and all too familiar.
trade and immigration are linked.
if the uk wants better access to indian markets, the government in delhi wants a looser approach to uk work and student visas.
this week saw britain's visa rules for foreign visitors tightened.
specific deals will be announced over the next 24 hours but more clarity around a trade relationship that has stagnated or even declined in recent years is likely to remain enveloped in the delhi smog.
visa issues risk dominating theresa may's first trade trip since becoming prime minister.
india's prime minister narendra modi told a technology summit in delhi he wanted to encourage "greater mobility" for its young people in education.
he said: "education is vital for our students and will define our engagement in a shared future.
"we must therefore encourage greater mobility and participation of young people in education and research opportunities."
cobra beer founder lord bilimoria earlier said restrictions on staying in the uk after their studies meant the number of indians attending uk universities had halved in the past five years.
he said "movement of people" would form a key part of any trade negotiations.
the number of study visas issued to indian nationals fell from 68,238 in the year to june 2010 to 11,864 five years later, official uk figures show.
the solution, according to karan bilimoria, is to exclude foreign students from britain's statistics on net migration, which mrs may has pledged to cut to below 100,000 annually - down from 336,000 in the year to june 2015.
"we need to immediately get the government, theresa may, on this visit to announce and say 'we're no longer going to include international students within the net migration figures,'" crossbencher lord bilimoria told bbc radio 4's the world this weekend.
he added: "the reality is theresa may when she was home secretary did deliver very, very negative messages towards immigration."
"she has got a lot of bridge-building to do when she goes to india."
mrs may will be accompanied on the three-day trip by international trade secretary liam fox and trade minister greg hands as well as representatives from 33 uk companies.
deals expected to be confirmed during the trip include:

the fbi has determined that a new batch of emails linked to hillary clinton’s private email server “have not changed our conclusion” that she committed no criminal wrongdoing, fbi director james comey told congressional leaders in a letter on sunday.
as campaigning continued ahead of tuesday’s presidential election, a clinton spokeswoman said the candidate was “glad this matter is resolved”.
the democratic nominee’s opponent, donald trump, reacted with anger at the news, and cast doubt on whether the fbi had even carried out its work.
“you can’t review 650,000 emails in eight days,” donald trump told a campaign rally in sterling heights, michigan, on sunday evening.
on 28 october, only 11 days before the presidential election, comey sent congressional leaders a letter informing them that agents had discovered emails “that appear pertinent” to a prior investigation, into clinton’s use of a private server while she was secretary of state.
it was later reported that as many as 650,000 such emails were in question.
the move, so close to an election, proved tremendously controversial.
in july, comey had announced that clinton and her aides were “extremely careless” but that “no reasonable prosecutor” would bring a case against them.
“since my letter, the fbi investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation,” comey wrote to congress on sunday.
“during that process, we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from hillary clinton while she was secretary of state.
“based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in july with respect to secretary clinton,” he concluded.
“i am grateful to the professionals at the fbi for doing an extraordinary amount of high-quality work in a short period of time.”
clinton was onboard her campaign plane when the news broke, as she had been when comey delivered his first letter nine days earlier.
as news broke, aides huddled toward the front of the plane, reading from an ipad, and spokeswoman jennifer palmieri entered clinton’s cabin, shielded by a curtain, moments before she spoke to the press.
“we are glad to see that [comey] has found, as we were confident he would, that he has confirmed the conclusions that he reached in july and we are glad that this matter is resolved,” she told reporters.
leaving the plane in cleveland, roughly 30 minutes after comey’s announcement, clinton did not respond to a reporter’s question about whether she had seen the letter.
when the letter was released, trump was speaking in an airplane hangar in minneapolis, but did not mention the letter to the crowd, instead directing his anger against his democratic rival.
in michigan, however, he said: “you can’t review 650,000 emails in eight days.
hillary clinton is guilty.
she knows it.
the fbi knows it, the people know it and now it is up for american people to deliver justice at the ballot box on 8 november.”
the republican nominee also insisted that despite comey’s actions, “the rank and file special agents at the fbi won’t let her get away with her terrible crimes including the deletion of 33,000 emails after receiving a federal subpoena”.
trump seemed to be alluding to leaks from within the bureau that revealed acrimony and political rifts within the fbi, after department of justice officials expressed surprise that comey would break with decades of tradition regarding investigations and elections.
other leading republicans tried to dismiss the fbi’s new conclusion.
“some things haven’t changed at all.
what fbi director comey said on 7 july under oath to congress is still the same: that she was reckless and careless in her handling of information,” trump’s campaign manager, kellyanne conway, told msnbc.
“the reason that so many americans have a problem with hillary clinton’s honesty and trustworthiness and veracity does not change.”
republican house speaker paul ryan also insisted that the new conclusion should not change any opinions about clinton.
“regardless of this decision, the undisputed finding of the fbi’s investigation is that secretary clinton put our nation’s secrets at risk and in doing so compromised our national security,” he said in a statement.
“she simply believes she’s above the law and always plays by her own rules.”
although ryan has endured spats with trump for months, he urged americans to vote for the businessman, as he did last week.
“fortunately, the american people have the opportunity to ensure secretary clinton never gets her hands on classified information again,” ryan said.
“let’s bring the clinton era to an end by voting for donald trump on tuesday.”
the new emails were discovered on a laptop belonging to anthony weiner, a disgraced former congressman who is the estranged husband of huma abedin, a close aide to clinton.
weiner is under investigation for allegedly exchanging sexually explicit messages with a minor.
comey’s first letter surprised both campaigns and cast the fbi into the middle of an bitter and volatile race.
senior democrats accused comey of political meddling, clinton said she found the letter “deeply troubling” and trump gleefully predicted the emails would reveal a corruption scandal “bigger than watergate”.
on sunday, adam schiff, the top democrat on the house intelligence committee, said comey’s letter should end “once and for all” accusations that clinton had committed any crime.
“while the original letter should never have been sent so close to an election,” schiff said, “the expeditious review of these emails should put to rest the irresponsible speculation indulged in by the trump campaign and others.”
the fbi said it had nothing to add to comey’s letter.
yet while the immediate drama has ended, comey remains in a precarious position.
john conyers, the ranking democrat on the house judiciary committee, hinted at political battles to come, saying: “we will have many questions about the fbi’s handling of this investigation.”
senator dianne feinstein, usually a staunch ally of the security agencies, said the end of what she called comey’s “october surprise” made his decision to intervene “even more troubling”.
feinstein called on the justice department to “look at its procedures to prevent similar actions that could influence future elections”.

maybe josé mourinho should watch from the stand more often.
serving a touchline ban, the manchester united manager savoured the sight of his team registering their first premier league victory in five matches as well as zlatan ibrahimovic rediscovering his touch in front of goal on an afternoon when swansea city capitulated and the simmering frustration among their supporters started to boil over.
ibrahimovic struck twice – his first goals in the premier league since 10 september – after paul pogba had opened the scoring with an exquisite shot from distance that set the tone for an embarrassingly one-sided first half in which swansea were outplayed.
united were 3-0 up inside 33 minutes and it felt like a trick of the mind that mourinho’s team had come into this game short of confidence and facing so many questions about their form.
swansea’s frailties were brutally exposed as united played with the belief and freedom that has been so badly missing of late.
michael carrick, who was making his first premier league start of the season, was excellent in the midfield holding role, wayne rooney thrived on the left and ibrahimovic looked as if he was enjoying playing football again.
it was, in short, just what united needed after that chastening defeat against fenerbahce in the europa league on thursday night and all the more satisfying for mourinho given that he was forced to name such a makeshift defence.
phil jones made his first appearance since january, ashley young was deployed at right-back, marcos rojo featured as an auxiliary centre-half and matteo darmian played out of position on the left.
that the four of them barely broke sweat when it came to their defensive duties in the first half says everything about swansea’s inept and listless performance.
second from bottom in the premier league and having picked up only two points from a possible 30 since their victory at burnley on the opening day, swansea are sleepwalking towards the championship.
the lack of commitment in the first half, when united had so much space and time on the ball, was arguably more worrying than the shortage of quality.
bob bradley, who has picked up only one point from his first four games in charge, admitted he was angry.
the fans felt the same way, although their fury was directed more at the directors’ box than the players.
“we want our club back” and “you greedy bastards, get out of our club” sang a section of supporters during the first half, with the board members who made millions out of the summer takeover the target of their ire.
huw jenkins, the club’s chairman and a man who could do no wrong at one time, was also singled out for abuse on a day when swansea were booed off at half-time and full-time.
“there’s only one way for us to win the support of the fans and that is to play better and take points,” bradley said.
“i know there’s some back and forth going on but from our side, the players and coaches, professionally we’ve got to focus on the only part we control, and that’s how we compete and fight for points.
the fans were angry with us at half-time and i understand.
the first half we did not do enough to win them over in any way and, with a 3-0 scoreline at half-time at home, they have every right to be angry at that point, and we have to be honest about the work that needs to be done.”
united’s first-half blitz started after 14 minutes and it was a quite brilliant goal that got them on their way.
mike van der hoorn’s headed clearance was poor but pogba, loitering about 22 yards from goal, showed wonderful technique to get over the top of a bouncing ball and send it arrowing into the top corner with his right boot.
swansea looked shellshocked, united were moving the ball around with ease and it was no surprise when the visitors added a second.
after a long period of united possession rooney laid the ball back and ibrahimovic, in an abundance of space, sidestepped ki sung-yueng’s half-hearted attempt to close him down before drilling a low shot from just outside the area that lukasz fabianski should have saved.
instead the ball slipped inside the swansea goalkeeper’s near post and ibrahimovic celebrated ending a run of 609 minutes without scoring in the premier league.
the swede soon had his second and united’s third.
linking well with rooney in the centre of the pitch after neatly controlling david de gea’s long ball upfield, ibrahimovic traded passes with the united captain, shrugged off àngel rangel and lifted the ball beyond fabianski.
it was to all intents game over with almost an hour remaining.
van der hoorn reduced the deficit in the second half when he headed in gylfi sigurdsson’s free-kick and modou barrow was later denied by de gea but there was never any prospect of a swansea comeback and juan mata, expertly set up by rooney, could easily have added a fourth.
the man at the center of a disturbance at a donald trump rally in nevada saturday claims he was beaten by the republican nominee's supporters, according to the u.k.'s guardian  newspaper.
in an interview with the media outlet, the man — who identified himself as austyn crites from reno — said that people turned on him when he held up a sign reading: "republicans against trump".
"there were people booing, that's expected right?
then all of a sudden these people next to me are just starting to get violent.
they are grabbing at my arm, trying to rip the sign out of my hand," he said.
"people started going crazy, these people who couldn't grab the sign, they started tackling me and then it just piled on.
someone yelled something about a gun.
i was yelling down there: 'there is no gun, i only have a sign'."
the report also states that the protester claims he was kicked, punched and choked, and feared for his life.
read the full report here.
the press office for donald's trump campaign wasn't immediately available for comment when contacted by cnbc.
trump was rushed off stage by secret service officers during the nevada speech because of the disturbance in the crowd.
the u.s. secret service released the following statement: "this evening at approximately 9:05 p.m. (est), at a presidential nominee trump rally in reno, nevada, mr. trump was removed from the stage by his secret service protective detail after a commotion occurred in the crowd."
"immediately in front of the stage, an unidentified individual shouted 'gun.'
secret service agents and reno police officers immediately apprehended the subject.
upon a thorough search of the subject and the surrounding area, no weapon was found."

donald trump stunned america and the world, riding a wave of populist resentment to defeat hillary clinton in the race to become the 45th president of the united states.
after running even with donald trump early last week, hillary clinton now holds a five-point lead in the latest post-abc tracking poll overall, as well as clear advantages on several personal attributes.
enthusiasm for clinton and trump now stands at rough parity, both significantly lower than it was among supporters of barack obama and mitt romney four years ago.
but clinton has a clear advantage in affirmative support, with 55 percent of her backers saying the main reason they are voting for her is because they support her, compared with 43 percent of trump voters.
more trump voters say they are voting for him mainly because they oppose clinton.
the post-abc poll finds clinton with a 48 percent to 43 percent lead in overall vote preferences, just on the edge of statistical significance but continuing a clear trend of improvement since the race was locked at 46 percent at the beginning of last week.
clinton has benefited from more united support from non-white voters as well as with "pure" political independents who do not lean toward either party.

clinton's advantage in the tracking poll is slightly larger than her standing in other national surveys released in the past week.
clinton was up three points in a cbs news/new york times poll, two points in a fox news poll, one point in a mcclatchy-marist poll and tied in the ibd/tipp daily poll released saturday -- results that lean in her favor, but not by a significant margin.
the new post-abc poll asked voters which candidate they favored across five personal attributes debated during the campaign, including honesty, empathy, qualifications, moral character and temperament.
clinton holds clear advantages on four of the five qualities, some by very large margins.
by 58 percent to 32 percent, more voters prefer clinton's personality and temperament, and by 55 percent to 36 percent, more say she has better qualifications for the job than trump does.
the democratic nominee also holds an eight-point advantage on the question of which candidate has a better understanding of the "problems of people like you," and a seven-point lead when voters are asked which candidate has stronger moral character.
but trump maintains a 44 percent to 40 percent edge over clinton on which candidate is more honest and trustworthy, though that result is down from an eight-point edge last week after the fbi announced the discovery of additional emails that might be relevant to from their investigation of her use of a private server while secretary of state.

across the broad swath of america that will decide the next president, the mood is bleak.
an uncivil war of rhetoric and resentments has scoured the country, unearthing deep ruptures.
the candidates are unpopular and disdained for their shortcomings.
voters are fed up, mad at each other and despairing...
while voter preference on candidate qualities seemed clear, they were more closely split on who they trust to deal with major policy issues.
a previous wave of the post-abc tracking poll released this week found neither candidate held a double-digit advantage on trust to handle the economy, terrorism, immigration, health care or corruption in government.
there are sizable minorities of trump and clinton supporters who do not vouch for some of their personal qualities.
about 82 percent of clinton supporters say she is more honest and trustworthy than trump, while 18 percent do not, saying neither is better than the other or that they have no opinion.
defections from trump are sharpest on the issue of personality and temperament, with 27 percent of his backers saying he does not have a better personality and temperament than clinton; 17 percent say he is not more qualified.
fewer than 2 in 10 of these voters say their vote for trump is mainly because they support him, while more than two-thirds say they are mainly voting against clinton.
voters' opinions on the personal traits of clinton and trump are closely tied to which candidate they support.
but the poll finds the connection is closer on the question of which candidate "better understands the problems of people like you."
fully 84 percent of likely voters say they support the candidate who is more empathetic, while only 1 percent choose the opposite.
the connection is weakest for temperament, with 77 percent supporting the candidate they prefer on this question while 6 percent choose the opposite (nearly all of them trump supporters).

the contrast between the candidates' results on personal characteristics helps explain trump's historically weak standing among white women with college degrees.
in the 2012 election, republican mitt romney won that group by six points.
today, the post-abc poll finds clinton leads that group by 16 points, 54 percent to 38 percent.
on all five attributes measured, white college-educated women prefer clinton to trump, and are more likely to say so than voters overall.
white women college graduates are 12 points more likely than voters overall to say clinton has better temperament than voters overall, 10 points more likely on "moral character," nine points more likely on empathy, eight points on honesty and seven points on overall qualifications.
in contrast to trump's struggles on personal traits among college-educated white women, he fared well compared to clinton when it comes to being trusted to handle some top issues in a previous wave of the post-abc tracking poll last week (where trump fared slightly better in overall voting).
trump topped clinton by six points on this group in trust to handle terrorism and national security, five points on handling corruption and four points on the economy, while trailing by seven on immigration and health care alike.

an earthquake measuring magnitude 5.0 shook central oklahoma on sunday, causing substantial damage to dozens of buildings.
the epicentre of the quake struck the city of cushing, about 50 miles (80km) north-east of oklahoma city, at 19:44 local time (01:44 gmt monday).
tremors were felt as far away as texas, and schools have closed in cushing.
authorities in cushing reported that at least 40 buildings were damaged.
no one was seriously injured.
photographs posted on twitter showed debris scattered alongside commercial buildings in the city.
there have been 19 earthquakes in oklahoma in the past week, according to data provided by the us geological survey.
in september, a magnitude 5.6 quake in the state fuelled concerns that seismic activity in the area was connected to energy production.
in 2013, scientists linked the underground injection of oil drilling wastewater to a magnitude-5.7 earthquake that struck oklahoma in 2011.
cushing, which has a population of about 7,900, is home to one of the largest oil storage facilities in the us.
no damage was reported there.

parliament must accept that britain's vote to leave the european union was legitimate and let the government get on with delivering brexit 'in full', prime minister theresa may said on sunday.
may has said she is confident of overturning a british court ruling that the government needs parliamentary approval to start the process of leaving the eu.
the ruling has provoked anger amongst ardent eurosceptics who fear lawmakers who supported staying in the bloc will try to water down the terms of britain's exit.
but, writing in the sunday telegraph newspaper, may signaled she would resist any such attempts.
"the people made their choice, and did so decisively.
it is the responsibility of the government to get on with the job and to carry out their instruction in full," may wrote.
the head of britain's opposition labour party said on sunday that he would try to block divorce talks with the eu if the government does not agree to his brexit demands.
the government, which has given little away about its plans for britain's future relationship with the eu, has said that having to set out a detailed negotiating strategy to parliament would put it at a disadvantage in talks with the bloc.
"it was mps (members of parliament) who overwhelmingly decided to put the decision in their (voters') hands.
the result was clear.
it was legitimate," may said in a separate statement ahead of her first trade trip to india on sunday.
"mps and peers who regret the referendum result need to accept what the people decided."
may will use her first bilateral trade trip since taking office to try to boost ties with india before britain leaves the eu and to pave the way for a free trade deal as soon as possible once brexit is completed.
brexit a slow motion economic car crash: strategist
bob mckee, chief economist at independent strategy ltd, explains his viewpoint that brexit will negatively impact the u.k. economy.
parliament could in theory block brexit as most members supported staying in the eu in june's referendum, although it is unlikely to do so.
the ruling could allow lawmakers to temper the government's approach, however, making a "hard brexit" - where tight controls on immigration are prioritized over remaining in the european single market - less likely.
a government appeal against the high court ruling is expected to be considered by britain's supreme court early next month.
may has said she still plans to launch talks on the terms of brexit by the end of march.
"we need to turn our minds to how we get the best outcome for our country," she said in the statement issued by her office.
"that means sticking to our plan and timetable, getting on with the work of developing our negotiating strategy and not putting all our cards on the table - that is not in our national interest and it won't help us get the best deal for britain."

much has been written about the possible effect on the financial markets of the u.s. presidential election and many investors are keen to get an angle in order to protect their portfolios.
suggestions such as adding to gold, s&p 500 put options and long japanese yen and swiss franc positions are sensible but predictable in advance of binary events that could have untoward effects on risk assets.
markets are rightly worried.
but the key question is whether investors should focus exclusively on hedging out risk using expensive instruments or dare to seek out opportunity.
binary outcomes have plagued investment this year, most notably in the form of china and brexit.
cutting exposure to risk assets might seem tempting ahead of a potentially market-moving event, but the danger is that a clinton win could see a relief rally that leaves portfolios behind.
while it's true that a trump sell-off is likely to be of a larger magnitude than a clinton relief rally, a fundamental analysis of global economic growth and equity markets suggests that sell-off is unlikely to translate into a long-lasting impairment.
this was certainly the case in january and june this year, when volatility spiked and investors panicked and then realized that the world was not about to end.
ambitious and active investors may even choose to add to risk assets in the event of a trump win.
that sounds counterintuitive, but faith in the fundamentals, combined with a cheap entry point, has always been a great way for truly exciting gains to be made.
and such a strategy would have paid off well at least twice so far this year.
of course, there will be those who declare that this time is different since america has never had to contend with a donald trump before.
and it is probably the case that bond yields will over time rise more under the fiscal expansion donald trump proposes than under hillary clinton's tax vision.
but for risk assets, consider this: does a trump victory really sound so much worse than a major china slowdown or britain's exit from the european union?
in the last decade, america's ceos have had to deal with the global financial crisis, huge increases in regulation and political gridlock in washington.
and they were still able to send corporate profits to their highest proportion of gross domestic product for decades.
history provides further context.
the great economic flowering of the us took part in the late 19th century, a politically forgettable patch between the presidencies of abraham lincoln and theodore roosevelt.
donald trump may be unappetising to some, but is he really going to be able to undo the economic and corporate fabric of america in the space of four years?
none of this is to diminish the high stakes at play in this election.
for some investors, the thought of adding to risk in the aftermath of a trump victory is simply too contrarian to stomach.
for them, a portfolio built around solid foundations of repeatable carry and intrinsic return is a sensible and viable way to invest.
but for the more opportunistic investor, a trump victory could provide a rare doorway to some solid economic and market fundamentals at compelling prices.
or to put it another way, just ask what it is that makes an investor cautious towards risk assets today.
is it a belief that the world is about to tip into recession and companies are becoming less profitable?
or is it the mere fact that markets are no longer cheap after seven years of largely unbroken progress?
conventional thinking suggests that hillary clinton is the pro-market choice.
but some investors may find themselves wishing for a trump victory as the trigger for an overdue market shakeout.
the real choice investors face ahead of this election is therefore between a low return, low volatility portfolio or one that is sufficiently imaginative to generate truly superior returns over time.

theresa may has insisted the government is "getting on" with brexit, following a high court ruling that parliament must vote on when the formal process of leaving the eu can get under way.
the prime minister urged mps and peers to "remember" the referendum result.
ukip leader nigel farage warned of protests on the streets if the decision in favour of brexit was ignored.
but the campaigner who brought the high court case said it would stop ministers acting like a "tin-pot dictatorship".
judges ruled on thursday that parliament should vote on when the government can trigger article 50 of the lisbon treaty, starting formal negotiations with the eu.
mrs may has promised to invoke article 50 by the end of next march.
the government argues ministers already have sufficient powers - under the royal prerogative - to do this without mps and peers having a vote.
it has vowed to fight to get the ruling overturned next month in the supreme court.
health secretary jeremy hunt told bbc one's the andrew marr show the prime minister had to be allowed "latitude" when negotiating with the eu over brexit.
he said: "the impact on the economy will be far worse if, through some parliamentary mechanism, theresa may is forced to lay out her entire negotiating strategy."
speaking on the way to new delhi for a trade visit, mrs may said the government had "strong arguments" in its appeal against the high court's decision.
she added that it was important to deliver on uk voters' desire to see a curb on free movement from the eu,
earlier, as she left the uk, the prime minister said: "the british people, the majority of the british people, voted to leave the european union.
the government is now getting on with that."
she added: "i want to ensure that we get the best possible deal for the uk as we leave the eu, that's the best possible deal for trading with and operating within the single european market.
"but alongside that, the uk will be a confident, outward-looking nation, taking its place on the world stage, looking to build relationships around the globe."
the row has escalated in recent days, with several newspapers being highly critical of the judges who made the high court decision, the daily mail branding them "enemies of the people".
the government says it will not be put off its brexit timetable.
under this, the two years of negotiations with the eu are due to end in 2019, when the uk will leave the 28-member organisation.
also speaking to andrew marr, ms miller, the investment manager who was the lead claimant in the high court case against the government, said: "everyone in this country should be my biggest fan, because we have used our own money to create certainty about the way ahead."
she added: "do we want a country where we have no process?"
"the case is that [mrs may] cannot use something called the royal prerogative to do it because we do not live in a tin-pot dictatorship," ms miller said.
but mr farage said the court's decision meant the country was faced with "half brexit", adding that the "reach of the european union into the upper echelons of this country makes it quite difficult for us to trust the judgement".
he warned: "if the people of this country think that they're going to be cheated, they're going to be betrayed, then we will see political anger, the likes of which none of us in our lifetimes have ever witnessed."
asked if there was a danger of disturbances in the street, he replied: "yes, i think that's right."
mr farage called for those who were in favour of brexit to take part in peaceful protests and in any election not support people who wanted to overturn the process.
meanwhile, labour deputy leader tom watson told bbc 5 live's pienaar's politics: "we are not going to hold this up.
the british people have spoken and article 50 will be triggered when it comes to westminster."
he added: "ultimately when the vote comes, labour will support theresa may to trigger article 50."
it comes after labour leader jeremy corbyn told the sunday mirror: "the court has thrown a big spanner in the works by saying parliament must be consulted.
we accept the result of the referendum.
"we are not challenging the referendum.
we are not calling for a second referendum."
but he said labour would push for the party's "brexit bottom lines", which include access to the european single market.
liberal democrat leader tim farron said political leaders had a "duty to calm tempers, heal division and work together to keep britain open, tolerant and united".
and scotland's brexit minister, michael russell, said he could not imagine any circumstances in which snp mps would vote in favour of triggering article 50.
hillary clinton blames her shock election defeat on interventions by fbi director james comey.

toys r us plans to open after thanksgiving dinner
the toy retailer aims to open its doors on thanksgiving day at 5pm local time for the fourth straight year.
toys r us once again will open its doors on thanksgiving day to welcome black friday shoppers.
the toy retailer plans to announce monday that its stores will open at 5 p.m. local time nov. 24 for 30 hours of continuous shopping.
this is the fourth year in a row the retailer has opened at this time.
"our customers have voted at the doors year after year, and they continue to want the option to get an early start on their holiday shopping lists," said joe venezia, executive vice president of global store operations at toys r us, in a statement.
toys r us plans to boost the number of employees working black friday and is prepping stores with toy experts, express checkout lanes and stocking its shelves with the hottest toys of the season.
one toy with a lot of buzz is spin master's hatchimals.
the interactive toy that hatches from a plastic egg has sold out at major retailers and will likely disappear fast when supplies are replenished.
"we knew as soon as we saw hatchimals that this was going to be one of the hottest toys of the holiday season, and we named it to our 'fabulous 15 list' for just that reason," a spokeswoman for toys r us told cnbc.
"we will have more hatchimals delivered right up until christmas, but gift givers should stop by their local store early and often, because these babies are literally flying off the shelves as soon as they arrive."
in addition, "star wars" toys, board games and video games sold at the retailer are expected to be popular this holiday.
last year, the toy industry saw its best sales in more than a decade and it is expected to see its sales grow by 6.5 percent this year, according to the npd group.

beirut —  the latest on the syrian conflict (all times local):
9 p.m.
france's defense minister says it will provide airstrikes to aid an offensive against the islamic state-held city of raqqa in northern syria.
jean-yves le drian told french radio europe 1 on sunday that "local territorial forces" should retake raqqa, with air support from french, american and other coalition forces but no foreign ground troops.
the syria democratic forces, a kurdish-led group that includes arab fighters and is backed by u.s. air power, announced the offensive earlier on sunday.
raqqa is the de facto capital of the extremist group's self-styled islamic caliphate.
france has long suspected that is planned last year's paris attacks in raqqa.
le drian linked the battle for raqqa with the iraqi offensive against the is-held city of mosul.
the two cities are the largest urban areas still under is control.
france began striking is targets in iraq in 2014 and in syria the following year, including in raqqa.

7:40 p.m.
a senior u.s. official says washington will provide air support for an offensive to retake the syrian city of raqqa, the de facto capital of the islamic state group.
brett mcgurk, the white house envoy to the u.s.-led military coalition against is, spoke to reporters in jordan after the offensive was announced sunday by the syria democratic forces, a kurdish-led group with arab fighters.
the envoy says the u.s. is also in "close, close contact" with its ally turkey.
the u.s. considers the syrian kurdish fighters to be among the most effective forces battling is, but turkey views them as a terror organization.
mcgurk says that "we want this to be as coordinated as possible, recognizing that there will be a mix of forces on the field."

7:20 p.m.
britain is providing aerial surveillance to help a newly launched offensive against the syrian city of raqqa, the de facto capital of the islamic state group's self-described caliphate.
defense secretary michael fallon says the royal air force "will support the raqqa operation as it develops."
he said the "sophisticated surveillance effort" would give the coalition a vital edge in syria.
a syrian kurdish-led force which is backed by u.s.-led air power announced an operation to retake raqqa earlier sunday.
fallon also said uk strikes are "making a difference" in the sustained assault against is in the northern iraqi city of mosul, where iraqi forces launched a major operation last month to drive out the extremists.

the two cities are the largest controlled by the extremist group.

7:15 p.m.
u.s. defense secretary ash carter has welcomed the announcement of an offensive to retake the syrian city of raqqa, the de facto capital of the islamic state group.
the offensive was announced sunday by the syria democratic forces, a kurdish-led group with arab fighters that is backed by u.s. air power.
carter says "the effort to isolate, and ultimately liberate, raqqa marks the next step in our coalition campaign plan."
he said that as in the iraqi city of mosul, the target of another anti-is offensive, "the fight will not be easy and there is hard work ahead."
but he says the operation is necessary to "disrupt the group's ability to carry out terror attacks against the united states, our allies and our partners."

6:50 p.m.
syrian activists are reporting heavy clashes between u.s.-backed kurdish-led syrian forces and islamic state militants north of raqqa.
the clashes just south of the kurdish-controlled town of ein issa were reported a few hours after the syria democratic forces, a coalition of kurdish and arab fighters, announced the start of their campaign to drive is out of raqqa, the de facto capital of the extremist group's self-styled caliphate.
the britain-based syrian observatory for human rights said sdf forces seized control of six small villages and farms in the northern raqqa countryside.
it reported strong activity by u.s.-led coalition warplanes and airstrikes that struck is positions.
the observatory also said is detonated two car bombs that targeted the advancing forces.

a raqqa-based syrian activist group known as raqqa is being slaughtered silently also reported the clashes.

5:45 p.m.
turkey's president says allied syrian opposition fighters are fast approaching the syrian town of al-bab, a stronghold of the islamic state group.
president recep tayyip erdogan said in a televised speech sunday that "our aim is to go to al-bab and expel them toward the south," adding that the opposition fighters were up to 9 miles (15 kilometers) from the town.
he did not comment on an announcement by syrian kurdish-led forces that they had launched an offensive to recapture the syrian city of raqqa, the de facto capital of the extremist group's self-styled caliphate.
both groups of syrian fighters have been battling is in recent months, but they have also turned their guns on each other.
turkey views the syrian kurdish forces as an extension of the kurdish insurgency in its southeast.
the turkey-backed forces have vowed to drive both is and the syrian kurdish forces from the border.
___
3:15 p.m.
syrian activists say a rocket or mortar barrage struck a preschool in an opposition-controlled suburb of the capital, damascus, killing at least six children.
the activist-run unified medical bureau of eastern ghouta reported the death toll and said medical facilities in the suburb of harista received tens of wounded children and adults following sunday's shelling.
advertisement
the locally-run education directorate said government forces struck the school during the first recess of the day.
it said more than 25 children were wounded in addition to the six killed.
the britain-based syrian observatory for human rights, which relies on a network of local activists, also blamed government forces for the strike.
___
1 p.m.
u.s.-backed kurdish-led syrian forces have announced the start of a campaign to retake the islamic state's de facto capital of raqqa from the extremist group.
the announcement by the syria democratic forces was made sunday at a press conference in ein issa, north of raqqa.
it comes more than two weeks after u.s.-backed iraqi forces began a campaign to clear is militants from their stronghold in mosul, iraq.
the sdf is dominated by the main syrian kurdish fighting force known as the people's protection units, or ypg.
the united states considers the syrian kurdish fighters as the most effective force against the is, but turkey views them as a terror organization and has said it will not accept a role for the kurds in the liberation of raqqa.

well that was impressive.
sure, watford were abysmal, but liverpool were the finest cheese wire, slicing through their static opponents with ruthless efficiency.
that’s them top of the premier league for the first time since may 2014 - that was the crystal palace collapse in the title race, which did technically take them back top of the league.
makes you wonder why they were so upset afterwards, really.

peeeeeeeeeeeeep-peeeeeeeep-peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep.
4.07pm gmt
16:07
90 mins + 1: from the corner, sturridge plays short, the ball finds its way to the kid ejaria in the area, he plays a beautiful flick back to sturridge.
the england man has another shot, again it’s saved by pantilimon, but wijnaldum is there and has time to control it on the edge of the box before slotting home.
that’s his first goal for liverpool.
4.05pm gmt
16:05
and there’s another.
updated
at 4.10pm gmt
4.05pm gmt
16:05
90 mins: the home fans are singing jurgen klopp’s name, which he asked them not to do (before the game was won) the other week.
they’re probably safe this time, mind.
meanwhile, sturridge has another shot from the right, but it’s saved by pantilimon.
4.04pm gmt
16:04
88 mins: my chuffing days, what a save.
sturridge lines a big one up from the edge of the area, to the right, it’s heading for the top corner(ish) and a flying pantilimon gets a fingernail to it, thus taking the ball away from net and onto crossbar.
firmino’s follow-up is saved by pantilimon.
it’s weird, but watford’s two goalkeepers today have let in five goals and haven’t done a massive amount wrong.
4.02pm gmt
16:02
87 mins: and that’s yer lot for coutinho - he’s off, and youngster ovie ejaria is on for his premier league debut.
for watford, pererya is replaced by zuniga.
4.00pm gmt
16:00
86 mins: and there’s another thing, and he should really have scored there.
or at least shot on target.
clyne made good tracks down the right, slid a pass inside from where coutinho has a good look and takes a shot, but it flies well over.
3.59pm gmt
15:59
84 mins: coutinho does something wrong!
well, well, well.
he flicks a pass slightly too long for firmino, and pantilimon claims.
3.56pm gmt
15:56
81 mins: henderson powers forwards, then smartly feeds sturridge on the right side of the box.
he cuts in and tries a guided left-footed shot, but that’s too close to pantilimon.
he might have played in coutinho, free(ish) to his left, but at 5-1 you can’t really blame him for shooting there.
3.55pm gmt
15:55
80 mins: weird one.
the free-kick from the right is boomed over to the back post, wijnaldum heads it back into the area where sturridge is, but he sort of turns his back on the ball as the looming figure of pantilimon, erm, looms.
updated
at 4.12pm gmt
3.54pm gmt
15:54
79 mins: yellow card for britos, after he clumsily/cynically barges can over on the liverpool right.
3.52pm gmt
15:52
78 mins: sturridge clangs one against the bar, after being fed on the left side of the area, he lets the ball drift across his body and thunks his shot onto the goal frame.
updated
at 4.06pm gmt
3.51pm gmt
15:51
77 mins: another chance for watford, this time from ighalo who finishes a counter off with a left-footed effort from the right, but that one was fairly easily saved by karius.
3.51pm gmt
15:51
75 mins: more lax defending, this time from liverpool, as janmaat is offered as much time as he felt comfortable with to pick his spot, and he selects the bottom corner of the net, guided home with his left foot.
3.49pm gmt
15:49
see, there’s always a bit of grit in the stew with liverpool.
updated
at 4.00pm gmt
3.48pm gmt
15:48
74 mins: great chance for watford, as deeney plays a smart reverse pass to capoue, through on goal, but karius dashes out, spreads himself and manages to keep the ball out...well, i think with his rump.
3.47pm gmt
15:47
73 mins: there’s henderson again, crossing from the right, but that’s headed clear with firmino lurking.
3.46pm gmt
15:46
71 mins: “sorry steven hughes is wrong and jim morrish is right,” says ts browning, who has almost certainly published three moderately successful volumes of poetry, with a name like that.
“hillary will win the election and then trump will launch a coup with the help of the fbi and the nra.
supreme leader trump will be safely in the oval office by wednesday.
don’t worry about it too much though because it won’t last long.
i’m sure the asteroid will wipe us all out before 2017...
but hey liverpool are top so it’s not all bad.”
3.44pm gmt
15:44
70 mins: and here’s danny sturridge - he dons his gloves and will have a 20-minute run-out in place of the excellent, quite excellent adam lallana.
updated
at 3.50pm gmt
3.44pm gmt
15:44
69 mins: and another!
watford take a corner short on the right, it’s whipped in low to the near-post where britos gets a touch, but karius again gets down to his left smartly to push it clear.
3.43pm gmt
15:43
68 mins: a chance for watford, would you believe.
a corner is cleared to the edge of the box, where capoue lines up a shot, it arrows towards the corner but karius dives nicely and pushes the ball away.
good shot, good save, good football everyone.
3.39pm gmt
15:39
64 mins: on liverpool’s choice of prematurely (although, as it turned out, correctly so) celebratory music philip podolsky writes: “one does wish football, as an institution, had a better taste in music... hollywood, too.”
3.38pm gmt
15:38
63 mins: “regarding can and henderson linking up in the box,” writes matt loten, “isn’t that just the embodiment of klopp-ball?
namely, that it’s a version of total football-lite, in that the front eight are completely interchangeable in their roles, whilst the two centre-halves stand around looking incompetent.
not that i’m complaining, mind you, this is the most thrilling, free-flowing football i’ve seen in the premier league since, uh, chelsea last night.”
3.37pm gmt
15:37
62 mins: sub for each team: watford remove behrami in favour of a stable door with a horse nowhere to be see...sorry, ‘ben watson’.
and for liverpool, gini wijdnaldum is on in place of mane.
3.36pm gmt
15:36
60 mins: superb composure from firmino, who looked in on the right but couldn’t quite create the space for a shot, so he checked back, waited for mane to make his darting run into the middle and slid it into his colleague’s path.
again, a liverpool forward slips betwixt two defenders and sidefoots home.
could be a (brackets) score, this.
3.35pm gmt
15:35
officially graduated to embarrassing territory for watford now.
updated
at 3.39pm gmt
3.33pm gmt
15:33
57 mins: clinical stuff from liverpool, but again helped out by a relaxed approach to defending from watford.
lallana crosses low from the left, firmino is there on the edge of the six-yard box, having wandered between two defenders, and he sidefoots home.
3.32pm gmt
15:32
all too easy.
updated
at 3.37pm gmt
3.31pm gmt
15:31
56 mins: ach, nasty one from holebas who sticks some studs on mane’s ankle.
not actually convinced it was 100% deliberate, more a hanging leg from a sliding challenge, but the yellow card is justified nonetheless.
3.30pm gmt
15:30
55 mins: “what’s been so awful about this year nick?
been a great one,” writes elliot wilson.
well i’m glad someone’s happy.
3.28pm gmt
15:28
53 mins: chance for liverpool, as henderson makes one of those now-rare runs into the box, he plays in can (which does lead to the question: who’s minding shop in midfield?
), the german doesn’t quite control it, the ball falls back to henderson whose shot rises, rises, rises.
3.26pm gmt
15:26
51 mins: oooh, nice bit of football from watford.
amrabat plays a nice ball into ighalo in the area, he makes a nice lay-off to janmaat coming in from the right, who shoots nicely, but karius saves.
nice.
3.24pm gmt
15:24
49 mins: “there’s still hope, mr morrish,” writes mark turner.
“trump doesn’t have coutinho cutting in from the left wing on his team.”
3.23pm gmt
15:23
48 mins: coutinho lines up another blooter, but after creating a spot of space for the shot, he couldn’t quite get enough whip on it to threaten the goal.
3.22pm gmt
15:22
47 mins: incidentally, that starship song featured in quite a sweet bit in quietly-decent film the skeleton twins.
3.21pm gmt
15:21
46 mins: anyway, we’re off for the second 45.
no changes at half-time, apart from perhaps the tinnitus in some watford defenders at the roasting mazzarri presumably gave them at half-time.
3.20pm gmt
15:20
if there’s one thing we can rely on, it’s liverpool getting giddily ahead of themselves: they just played this over the pa...
3.19pm gmt
15:19
i knew this was coming.
but it probably needed to be said, by steven hughes, in response to jim morrish: “pedantry corner: no, i think we can safely say that president obama will be in the oval office until 20th january 2017 as there’s always that gap between someone winning the presidency and them being sworn in.
“when black-hearted disgraces take over in the uk, at least we’re thrown right into dante’s inferno whereas americans will have an awful 11 weeks or so of anticipation, dread and conducting a left-wing circular firing squad before the tiny-handed maniac even begins his rotting the usa out from the inside, if he wins on tuesday.”
3.07pm gmt
15:07
jim morrish has spotted four mangy-looking blokes on horses on the horizon: “cubs win the world series.
all blacks lose to ireland.
liverpool top of the league.
“i think we can safely say president trump will be in the oval office on wednesday.”
3.06pm gmt
15:06
peeeeeeeeeeeeep-peeeeeeeep-peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep.
quite the performance, that.
admittedly against bright white traffic cones for most of the time, but still.
updated
at 3.09pm gmt
3.04pm gmt
15:04
45 mins +4: “we’re gonna win 4-3,” goes the customary chant from the away end.
3.03pm gmt
15:03
45 mins + 2: should be four - lallana plays a delicious reverse pass to can (again in acres), and his square ball across the six-yard box eludes everyone, firmino being the closest liverpool forward to the chance.
but let’s give them that one, shall we?
3.02pm gmt
15:02
45 mins: free-kick on the left side of the box for liverpool, and sneaky little jimmy milner tries to sneakily sneak a shot in at the near-post.
but wily ol’ pantillimon knew his game, and used every inch of his 11ft 15 frame to paw it away.
3.00pm gmt
15:00
44 mins: watford have a shot!
capoue fires in from outside the area, and karius does well to keep hold of it, with ighalo lurking, waiting to snaffle the rebound.
2.59pm gmt
14:59
43 mins: liverpool have been superb but that was embarrassingly easy for liverpool: lallana clips a cross to the far post, but can had been allowed to amble in completely unmarked, and thus guides a header past gomes with the utmost ease.
klopp almost slips over when celebrating.
2.58pm gmt
14:58
liverpool are going top of the league.
updated
at 3.06pm gmt
2.58pm gmt
14:58
42 mins: ....and that free-kick is punched clear by karius, it drops to amrabat but his volley is way off.
2.57pm gmt
14:57
41 mins: pererya flings himself to the turf after a mild 50-50 with mane.
free-kick to watford, out on the left touchline.
2.56pm gmt
14:56
39 mins: a quieter period: by which i mean liverpool haven’t had a shot for about five minutes.
point of note: miles jacobson, the brains behind football manager, is in the crowd, presumably as a guest of watford.
2.53pm gmt
14:53
37 mins: calling it now: he’s decent.
as it stands (35 minutes gone) coutinho has a goal or assist every 71 minutes for liverpool this season.
2.52pm gmt
14:52
35 mins: this is following a similar pattern to the west brom game from a few weeks ago: liverpool have been absolutely superb, scoring two goals when they could’ve had more.
on that occasion they didn’t add to that brace, and were left with a twitchy last few minutes when their defence inevitably caved in.
thus, to make scousers everywhere feel a little more relaxed, they’ll need another one or two at some stage.
2.50pm gmt
14:50
34 mins: again, the odd wobble in the liverpool defence, as capoue puts pressure on them.
but they hold ‘firm’ this time.
2.48pm gmt
14:48
32 mins: bad to worse for watford: gomes, who had been keeping the score respectable, appears to have hurt himself in trying to prevent that goal.
could be a twisted ankle or similar, but he’s being helped off and costel pantillimon will come on.
updated
at 2.55pm gmt
2.47pm gmt
14:47
30 mins: liverpool’s front four really are sensational.
they combine with incredible fluidity, passing along the 30-yard mark and it eventually finds coutinho, who does one of those brilliant touches that’s a first and a second all in one, then he fires home from the edge of the box.
ryanair hiked its long-term growth forecast by 10 percent on monday, saying it expected to carry 200 million passengers per year by 2024 by taking capacity from rivals struggling to make a profit as competition pushes down prices.
ryanair, already europe's largest carrier by passenger numbers selling 119 million tickets per year, earlier this month announced plans to carry an extra 2 million passengers in its current financial year as rivals cut back.
the irish airline also announced plans to return 550 million euros ($608.85 million) to shareholders by february in a share buyback.
ryanair three weeks ago cut its profit forecast for the year to march by 5 percent due to sterling weakness and the impact of intense competition on fares to between 1.3 billion euros and 1.35 billion euros.
on monday it said it was comfortable with that forecast, but said it was heavily dependent upon there being no unexpected adverse declines in airfares in the three months to march.

kagiso rabada took three wickets and temba bavuma produced a stunning piece of fielding as south africa closed in on a first test victory by reducing australia to 169 for four, still 369 runs behind, at the end of the fourth day on sunday.
the hosts had started their pursuit of their unlikely victory target soon after lunch when south africa skipper faf du plessis declared at 540-8, a lead of 538, having all but batted australia out of the contest.
bavuma’s brilliant run out ended david warner’s bright start before 21-year-old rabada removed shaun marsh, steve smith and adam voges to finish the day with figures of 3-49 off 16 overs.
usman khawaja survived an early scare when a drs review saved him from a duck and will resume unbeaten on 58 with all-rounder mitchell marsh, who was 15 not out, as the australians look to bat out the final day at the waca ground.
warner appeared ready to chase down the full 539 target himself when he opened the innings at a fair lick with 35 runs from 33 balls.
south africa’s pace attack, reduced to vernon philander and rabada after the loss for the series of an injured dale steyn, were struggling for the breakthrough until the intervention of bavuma.
having just hit his sixth four, warner was cantering down the wicket for a single when the diminutive bavuma acrobatically swept up the ball and, while still airborne, flicked it at the base of the middle stump.
marsh departed four balls later for 15, catching an edge to a rabada delivery, but after khawaja’s reprieve off the first ball of the next over, australia made it to tea without any further damage.
smith looked set on 34 until rabada finally got his length right and found a bit of outswing in a beautiful delivery that caught a fine edge off the bat and carried to quinton de kock behind the stumps.
another superb rabada delivery in his next over had voges flummoxed and he departed for one run in similar fashion.
australia captain smith had earlier bowled philander for 73 to bring an end to three hours of frustration for the hosts as south africa added another 150 runs to their overnight tally of 390-6.
de kock made 64 before he was caught at short leg but philander and debutant spinner keshav maharaj (41 not out) continued to plunder runs off the exhausted australian bowlers.
the highest successful fourth-innings run chase in test cricket was the 418-7 west indies scored to beat australia at antigua in may 2003, while south africa scored 414-4 to beat their hosts at the waca in 2008.
the proteas will therefore be confident of taking a 1-0 lead in the three-match series, which continues in hobart before concluding with a day-night test in adelaide.

london —  british prime minister theresa may has shrugged off an adverse court ruling on her government's plans to leave the european union and maintains that brexit will be carried out in full.
she used a sunday telegraph column to say her government will "get on with the job" despite a high court ruling requiring her to seek parliamentary approval before triggering the exit process.
may says the government hopes to win a reversal of that decision before the supreme court because an important principle is at stake.
she says parliament voted to put the decision on eu membership "in the hands of the people" in the june 23 referendum, the vote was decisive in favor of leaving the 28-nation bloc and that choice must be respected.
brexit offers a "great national opportunity" to "forge a bold, confident global future for britain," said may, who spoke out in favor of staying within the eu during the hard-fought referendum campaign.
she was travelling to india on sunday with a delegation of business leaders to conduct her first trade mission as prime minister in order to emphasize the importance of "the relationships we have with our friends and allies overseas."

despite may's optimism, the high court ruling risks delaying the brexit process that may has pledged to formally begin by the end of march.
some in parliament are pressuring her to spell out britain's negotiating position before parliament, which she refuses to do.
may's plan to invoke article 50 to formally begin the divorce from the eu before april is almost certain to be opposed in parliament by scottish national party lawmakers, scotland's brexit minister said sunday.
unlike much of the uk, scottish voters expressed a preference for staying inside the eu.
michael russell said the pro-independence party with 54 members in parliament has a strong mandate to protect scotland's place in the eu, which could justify blocking the government's plans.
he said his party believes that keeping britain inside europe's single market of over 500 million people must be a top priority of any brexit negotiations.
"at the very least, membership of the single market must be paramount in our position," he said.
u.k.
independence party acting leader nigel farage said sunday there's a risk of unrest if british voters feel their will is being thwarted by lawmakers.
"believe you me, if the people in this country think they're going to be cheated, they're going to be betrayed, then we will see political anger the likes of which none of us in our lifetimes have ever witnessed," he told bbc interviewer andrew marr.
