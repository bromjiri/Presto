We can refinance the pension debtThis is a strategy that crops up routinely and has been employed in the past with some success.
Extending the repayment period would make the annual cost more manageable.
The average PERS benefit is only $29,720 yearThough true, it's not a very useful measure of the system's generosity.
Many retirees only work at a public job for a few years, then let their pensions ride with PERS while they seek employment elsewhere.

When you turn a profit on the sale of assets, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds or real estate, it’s called a capital gain.
—When you turn a profit on the sale of assets, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds or real estate, it’s called a capital gain.
In most cases, however, the tax rate on capital gains is lower than the rate on your regular income.
The exact capital gains tax rate you’ll pay depends primarily on two things: how long you hold the asset before selling, and your income.
The tax code divides capital gains into two types: long-term and short-term.
When you make a profit on the sale of an asset you’ve held for one year or less, that’s defined as a short-term gain.
The tax rate on a long-term gain is lower than what you pay on your ordinary income, such as wages.
Short-term gains, on the other hand, are taxed at your ordinary tax rate.
)To ensure your gain is the long-term type, pay close attention to the calendar when selling your assets.
The holding period for a long-term capital gain is at least one year and a day.
When a gain is short-term, it is taxed at the exact same rate as your ordinary income.
The 20% capital gains tax rate applies to taxpayers whose earnings put them in the highest federal income tax bracket (39.6%).
You’ll pay a 15% long-term capital gains tax rate if you’re in the next four lower tax brackets: 35%, 33%, 28% and 25%.
Capital gains taxes apply only when you have an actual profit from the sale of an asset.
