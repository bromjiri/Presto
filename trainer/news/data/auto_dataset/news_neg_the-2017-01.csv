Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said on Friday some new policies could help economic growth and others might slow it down.
Most of the rise in inequality happened over a decade ago (see chart 1).
Polls usually suggest that Americans care less about inequality than they do about economic opportunity.
And voters have reason to worry about stagnation in the middle-classes.
Unlike the mortgage-interest deduction, this does help many poor workers.
The poorer half of Americans pay roughly as much in taxes as they receive in cash redistribution, in spite of the EITC.
Before the financial crisis, government redistribution kept median incomes rising even as wages stagnated (see chart 3).
Since then it has kept incomes flat as wages have fallen.
The economic safety net for the poorest, however, remains perilously thin by international standards.
Partly as a result, relative poverty is higher than every other member of the club bar Israel.
This looks even worse as the lower-paid have borne the brunt of rising inequality.
That all still leaves those whose earnings place them between the middle and the poor.
Today, rising inequality in wealth, rather than in wages, might be a bigger concern.

How badly Chinese growth could be hurt by new trade barriers may be the most pressing question facing the world economy.
At this point, though, there’s no way of knowing how severe the storm will be.
The worst offender is Germany, whose record-breaking surpluses just keep growing.
Nearly half the responsibility for absorbing foreign surpluses now falls onto U. S. consumers.
Even so, the risk of trade tensions could sharpen incentives for China’s policymakers.
This is just passive rebalancing, and at this pace it will take nearly a decade before consumption meaningfully drives the economy.
In the near term, ironically, none of this might seem relevant.
As long as it depends on such surpluses to resolve domestic demand, the Chinese economy will remain vulnerable to trade war.

The Gap has badly lagged the overall market for an extended period.
The reason for The Gap's struggles is that its fundamentals are deteriorating.
Banana Republic really dragged the company down in 2015, with a 10% decline in comparable sales for the year.
The decline in sales and earnings was once again mostly because of underperformance at Banana Republic.
This was a huge disappointment, as retailers like The Gap rely on the holiday shopping season.
The Gap ended last quarter with a 4% inventory decline.
Higher spending caused the company's earnings per share to decline 9.5% in fiscal 2016.
While in-store traffic numbers are still declining, comparable sales and customer satisfaction are on the rise.
The stock suffered throughout 2016.

Furthermore, Macy's believes full year 2016 comparable sales are expected to decline 2.5%-3%.
And, while sales are set to decline this year, the company still expects full year earnings per share of $2.95-$3.10 per share.
And, the stock now sports a hefty 5% dividend yield.
Kohl's (NYSE:KSS)Last but not least is Kohl's, another department store that is suffering from the "death of shopping malls."

Eric Greitens and the issue of gaming expansion in Illinois are factors in what happens this year in the St. Louis casino market.

Growth in the billion-dollar St. Louis casino market fell just short of matching the statewide figure.
Last fall, the state gaming commission estimated Missouri will get $600,000 each year in fantasy sports taxes.
The issues are casino expansion and competition from video games that provide betting.
Holmes said video games are a factor in the decline of Illinois casino revenue, which fell 1.7 percent last year, to $1.4 billion.
Key to the issue is whether a deal is reached that would fulfill Chicago’s desire for a downtown casino, Holmes said.
Hard hit in the St. Louis market is its smallest casino — Argosy — where revenue fell 10 percent last year.

The bond issue on which Mozambique is about to default is the $727m Eurobond, due January 2023.
This is the bond issued in April 2016 to refinance Mozambique’s notorious 'tuna bonds'.
More importantly, the bonds proved unaffordable.
Servicing the debt (interest and principal) required income of $260m per annum.
But the anticipated yearly tuna catch of 200,000 tonnes never materialized: in 2014, Ematum reported a loss of $25m.
The trouble was that Mozambique's government had guaranteed the tuna bonds.

If sales growth misses expectations, the company should be able to find offsetting cost cuts to reach its profitability goals.
)Nevertheless, it will be very challenging for J. C. Penney to maintain its earnings momentum with stagnant comparable-store sales.
C. Penney still has a substantial debt load despite its debt reduction efforts of the past two years.
As a result, it runs the risk of lurching from crisis to crisis if it can't get comparable-store sales growing again.

The taper tantrum of 2013 was premature, which is often the case, as you'll see in a moment.

BOSTON, Jan 20 (Reuters)...5 innovations in radiology that could impact everything from the Zika virus to dermatology
The unemployment rate did fall a tenth of a percentage point, to 5.2 percent.
The public sector cut 4,200 jobs, a normal seasonal decline as schools closed for winter break.
The national jobless rate was 5% in December.
Manufacturers in the state eliminated the most jobs last year, losing a net 7,600 employees.
So let's take a look at what caused all of this investor pain in 2016 and what the coming year has in store.
To really understand why that was such a lousy time, though, you have to back up a little further.
These seemed at the time like surmountable issues, but then the wheels started to fall apart.
Jamex stopped meeting its obligations under the contract, for which Bridger was liable.
You know, that time when all the bad news gets sent in.
Probably, the worst is over.
From an investor standpoint, probably the most concerning thing is that management tried to sweep these issues under the rug for a while.

The first is a preference for real-world issues over abstraction.

In the past decade or so Mr Navarro has penned three books warning darkly of the dangers posed by China’s economic and military rise.
The core allegations Mr Navarro makes against China are not all that controversial.
But this interpretation does not explain Mr Navarro’s oddest views, like his opinion of the trade deficit.
Mr Trump spouts similar lines, talking about the trade deficit as if it were simply lost American wealth.
Were Americans unable to buy cheap imports, they would be poorer, with less to spend on other things.
Ben Bernanke, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve, suggested in 2005 that it contributed to a “global saving glut”.
That probably means more than the retaliatory duties already imposed on some Chinese goods.
Mr Navarro says that Mr Trump is merely threatening an across-the-board tariff, in order to exact concessions from the Chinese.
This was one aim of the doomed Trans-Pacific Partnership.

Days after the Journal reported on the company's layoff plans, Wal-Mart said it would create 10,000 new U. S. jobs this year.
The Grand Rapids Taxpayers Association has pledged to vigorously oppose the proposal.
This is for a few reasons, including that Ohio's working-age population is increasing more slowly than the nation as a whole.
"By adding more jobs than is required, you might actually see the unemployment rate fall.
"Martin's research doesn't probe why Ohio's net in migration lags that of the nation.
Zeller said not exploring the reasons for the state's low net in-migration was a missed opportunity.
"Thus, the net migration is negative.
The slow job growth causes the population net migration loss, not the other way around as the Fed falsely claims.
"But, lacking the 100,000 new jobs, we still have had substantial levels of out migration and slow in migration.
Under this scenario, Ohio's unemployment rate would remain the same even though the state would lose 970 jobs a month.

As a result, Generation X and older millennials are the most debt-laden people in U. S. history.
Back in 2014, researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis looked at how debt levels varied by the age of the head of household.
"What is the true cost of all this household debt?
Most people know -- many through grim experience -- that when their incomes don't grow as much as they expected, debt can magnify the pain.
Another problem is that unexpectedly low inflation, like the kind the U. S. has had in recent years, can be hard on debtors.
But there's one more cost of debt that gets discussed less often -- loss optionality.
Another reason is that debt has an all-or-nothing structure -- if you miss one payment, you're technically in default.
Standard economics, as usual, says that these aren't much of a problem.

Volatility drag significantly degrades the value of XIV price over time, but does not affect the price of VXX the same way.
The four daily factors are not strictly isolated over longer periods.
Analysis that does not account for this will be slightly inaccurate, but results will be in the right ballpark.
The volatility component.
As cited above, one independent component of daily changes in the short-term VIX futures indexes is the change in volatility.
As used in this article, volatility drag refers to the difference between average daily returns and actual compound returns.
A key principle that further informs this discussion is the mean-reversion of volatility.
While most stocks tend to increase in value over time, volatility, as measured by the VIX, does not.
Although the VIX fluctuates wildly on a daily basis, over time VIX eventually reverts to its mean value.
When vol mean-reverts, which it must do eventually, the cumulative return of the volatility component is 0%.
This implies that volatility drag is a non-factor for the isolated volatility component of long volatility positions.
In other words, when vol mean-reverts, the change in VXX is not affected by volatility drag, treated as an independent factor.
In the general case, cumulative changes due to the volatility position will exactly match market changes in vol over the same period.
The daily volatility component of XIV is - d(vol).
Therefore the average of - d(vol) must be negative.
The second column contains artificial values of 1 +d(vol) for each of ten market days, reflecting daily volatility component changes in VXX.
Thus, 1 + d(vol) is the daily change multiplier for volatility.
Column 2 represents the daily change multipliers for the isolated volatility component.
The fifth column collects the cumulative change multipliers for the short volatility position.
This emphasizes the influence of volatility drag in terms of degrading the value of inverse ETPs like XIV.
The data in columns 2 and 3 were randomly generated.
In this example, the error is small, but real.
The isolated eRoll component indicates an overall loss of 93.40%.
If the four components were isolated over the four-year period, the cumulative change in VXX would be -95.55% (col 5).
Cross-contamination of the four contributors affects the overall result by 0.10%.
The isolated volatility component shows a loss of 78.38% over the four-year period.
Cross-contamination affects the overall result by 6.01%.
Even though the incorrect calculation produced a small error, the procedure may be acceptable for ballpark estimates.
The error is expected to be negligible over short time frames, but should increase as time frames grow longer.
