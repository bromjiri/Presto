Driving on the beach was later eliminated as well.
Mayor Hans Tanzler, a big proponent of the beach park, held a seafood cookout there that year, praising those behind the effort.
But he figures he — and everyone else in the area — gained an undeveloped beach that's going to stay that way.
"That was our whole push, to keep it as natural as we could but to get all the necessary improvements in to make it usable for the public.
"Designers wanted to take advantage of the beach and of the lakes just inland, created by coquina mining operations.
But its default setting became nature: The woods were left pretty much as they were found, the dunes were left to stand up to storms.

Kooyman said two parking structures located across Brea Boulevard provide adequate public parking for the area – more than 1,000 spaces.
The three-level, $10.3 million parking structure on Birch and Orange is being built for convenience rather than necessity, he said.
Regardless, Manzella said, he’s learned over the years that diners won’t park across Brea Boulevard to visit his restaurants.

Put another way, only 4 percent of America's top companies are run by women.
In other words, the women who do beat the odds are well-paid, but the ones who actually make it to the top are few and far between.

"There's a discrepancy in how men and women perceive support for women at work for simple but powerful reasons," she said.
The good news is that some companies are realizing a higher ratio of women, especially in the top ranks, is a goal worth striving for.

First they tested how many people would hold off claiming in order to get a higher lifetime benefit in the current Social Security program.
They also studied how the need to work while waiting to earn those higher benefits would change claiming decisions.

"The one good thing is that interest rates were quite low.
Average long-term mortgage rates were above 6 percent during the height of the last housing boom, and they hadn't hit 5 percent before 2008.
If mortgage rates continue to climb, there are moves that would-be homebuyers can make to better offset some of the higher borrowing costs.
Or go with an adjustable-rate mortgage, which has a low fixed  rate for a few years, typically five or 10, then adjusts to a higher rate.
That can free up more cash for buyers to manage the higher borrowing costs.

The primary benefit municipal bonds have over corporate bonds is that their interest is always exempt from federal taxes.
Better yet, if you buy municipal bonds issued by your home state, you won't pay any state or local taxes, either.
According to the Federal Reserve Board, by the end of 2015, there were $3.7 trillion in outstanding municipal bonds.
While municipal bondholders did take a hit when that happened, defaults in the municipal bond world are actually pretty rare.
Nobody wants a bond issuer to default, but it's what happens afterward that ultimately has the greatest impact on investors.
Furthermore, recovery rates for municipal bonds are typically higher than those of corporate bonds.
What tends to further reassure investors is the fact that many municipal bonds are insured.

Daily changes in the indicative price of XIV can be calculated precisely by combining four mutually-independent contributions.
The contango (effective roll) component.
We identify this independent contribution as the effective roll, eRoll.
The precise mathematical expression for the daily effective roll was published in Article I and in Article II, both linked above.
The fractional daily change in the index due to the effective roll, d(eRoll), is given dividing eRoll by yesterday's value of vol.
d(eRoll) is a pure, independent component, and is not influenced by any other factors.
Nevertheless, over the long term, the ETP market values track their respective indicative values quite well.
Using the relationships shown above, the difference simplifies to fee of VXX +fee of XIV - 2 d(int).
During the same time frame, the average daily value of d(vol) must be positive.
Over the time frame corresponding to mean reversion, the average value of d(vol) must be positive, as discussed.
Compare this to the actual cumulative index gain of 2.91%, as shown in column 5.
It bears repeating that this analysis is based on the indicative ETP prices, which can be calculated precisely.
In the long term, the effective roll cost, which is inseparably linked to F1/F2 contango, plays a large role.
