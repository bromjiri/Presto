The four independent contributions include changes in volatility, effective roll costs, interest income, and ETP fees.
This is illustrated by a $100 stock that loses 50% one day (new value = $50), and then gains 50% the next day (final value = $75).
Only the volatility and eRoll components are included (neglecting income and fees) to simplify the example.
For VXX, the isolated volatility component will always track price changes in vol precisely.
Whenever F1/F2 contango exists, which is the norm in calm markets, the eRoll factor works to degrade the price of VXX.
If volatility drag were completely absent, the actual change of -31.45% in vol would have translated to a gain of 31.45% in the inverse ETP.
The isolated eRoll contribution, which benefits from normal contango in the F1/F2 futures, indicates a whopping gain of 1,393.77%.
Clearly, much of this gain is erased by the effects of volatility drag.
Given that contango is the norm in the short-term futures market, contango is the most important cause for the deterioration of VXX prices.
The article asserts that short VXX positions typically outperform long XIV positions over limited time frames longer than one day.
Shorting stocks and ETPs have other significant disadvantages and risks that are not discussed in this article.
Comparing the two, the volatility contribution was typically 6.7% times larger than the contango contribution on any given day.
Beware that volatility ETPs are extremely volatile and bear the risk of significant trading losses.
