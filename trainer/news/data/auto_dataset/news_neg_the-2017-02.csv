The problem threatens the performance of small thrusters attached to the interceptors.
In the event of a nuclear attack, the thrusters would be relied on to steer interceptors into the paths of enemy warheads, destroying them.
The test was designed to show whether a redesign of the thrusters had solved persistent problems with the component.
The Times disclosed the mishap in an article published July 6.
A review board formed by the missile agency linked the failure to a circuit board that powers the thrusters.
The aim would be to see whether more foreign objects shake loose.
The interceptors are multistage rockets, each with a 5-foot-long “kill vehicle” at the tip.
The thrusters have been at the center of several of those failures.
The downside of this approach has been diminished reliability.
Project engineers had planned for the interceptor to fly within a narrow “miss distance” of its target.
The report cited the review board’s finding that “foreign object damage” was the most likely cause.

A big reason for that is the acquisition Shell made during the oil downturn when competitors were mostly focusing on cutting costs.
The bottom line declined an even more painful 70%.
In other words, every company was feeling the pinch of an oil downturn.

But Shell's long-term debt increased around 50% over 2015's final figure, standing at $83 billion by the end of 2016.
